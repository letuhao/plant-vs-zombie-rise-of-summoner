"""Tool registry: scope labels + adapter mapping (spec: adapter-only).

SCOPES is closed (live-probe-standard two scopes). check_mapped() enforces
the adapter rule: every tool names an existing endpoint/service/CLI/file as
its source; an orphan (source None/empty) is reported, never passed.

Route allowlist is GENERATED at build from DebugEndpoints.cs registrations
(spec decision) and re-checked live by test_registry. Scope derivation mirrors
guard-debug-scope semantics: a 3-arg MapPost(g, path, "command") is a relay
wrapper by construction; otherwise any Send(hub/inbox, ...) in the handler
span makes the route game-injector-debug-shaped, while a persisted/domain
write with no relay makes it rpg-server-debug-shaped.

    to hide newly-added routes (/game-state, /ui-nav) for the lifetime of this
