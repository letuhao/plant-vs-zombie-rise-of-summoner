"""debug_ui_nav: call one real UIMgr static navigation method by name.

Adapter over POST /api/debug/ui-nav (DebugEndpoints.cs). Added 2026-09-14 to close a named gap:
debug_call can already reach /ui-nav generically once the route is in the allowlist, but this
game's menu stack is not flat -- a single action rarely reaches the intended screen, and an agent
should not have to rediscover the working sequence by trial and error each session. Real sequence
proven live the same day: a defeated board needs `back-to-menu` THEN `enter-main-menu` (two calls)
to reach the true main menu; `back-to-menu` alone lands on the previous menu layer instead (e.g.
Challenge Mode select).

Never spawns test subjects, never fabricates a result -- every action is the literal real UIMgr
static method call; the injector doing nothing (`ok: true` when the game is unresponsive) or
already-there (harmless to repeat) is possible and is not caught here. Only a genuinely wrong or
unreachable `action` name, or the injector not being connected, are refused/surfaced as errors.
