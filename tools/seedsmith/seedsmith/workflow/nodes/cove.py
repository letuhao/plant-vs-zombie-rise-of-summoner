"""Chain-of-verification — SPECIFIED IN FULL, NOT WIRED IN (spec-quality-gates.md §2.3).

⛔ **Why it exists but is off.** Measured on the real shoehorned outputs tier 2 had passed:

  * SUBJECTIVE form ("does this use the keyword meaningfully?") — agreed with human judgement
    **1/3**. It passed BOTH shoehorned cases, rationalising them (*"'一类' defines a specific
    category of behavior"*). Any text can be rationalised, so a subjective verifier defaults to
    charitable and catches nothing.
  * SOURCE-GROUNDED form ("what does the source say this demon does? is the draft consistent?") —
    **2/3**. It caught both shoehorned cases. Its one miss was a FALSE POSITIVE on good content.

So CoVe works only source-grounded, and even then it rejects good content sometimes.

⛔ **And it is not built into the default graph**, because shoehorning is caused by BAD MOTIFS,
which `motif-prose-filter` (G1) fixes at the source for zero model cost. CoVe treats the symptom at
3-4x the calls plus a false-positive rate. Build it only if shoehorning is MEASURED to persist
after G1 — `spec-pipeline.md:109`'s own rule applied to ourselves.
