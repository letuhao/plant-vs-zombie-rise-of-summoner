"""seedsmith.workflow.validators — tier-2 deterministic checks (spec-quality-gates.md §2.2).

Pure functions, no model, no LangGraph. Each returns a list of defect strings that name the FIELD
and the OFFENDING VALUE, because those strings become the repair prompt (`spec-pipeline.md` §3.6:
"name the exact defects"). Every validator here traces to a defect observed in a real run.

⛔ **A tier-2 pass is NOT a quality result (§2.4).** Measured: 8/8 first-attempt pass on visibly
shoehorned content. "Uses the token" is mechanically checkable; "uses it meaningfully" is not.
`TIER` exists so a caller cannot report one as the other by accident.
