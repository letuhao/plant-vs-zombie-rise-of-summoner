"""`set-charm-gen` (item module 13, spec-set-charm-gen.md). Thin wiring only, matching
`effect_affix.py`'s own shape exactly — this module carries no `StateGraph(` call of its own, only
`build_generation_graph`.

⛔ **This is the file module 13 named as missing.** Its own deferred entry reads: *"The generation
graph is not wired, and `--write` says so instead of writing nothing. A `workflow/graphs/item_set.py`
(mirroring `workflow/graphs/effect_affix.py`) is what connects `plan_run`'s subjects to
`llm_caller`."* This is that file. The one deviation from the sentence: `call` is **injected**, so
the same graph drives a live endpoint, a recorded answer file, or a raising stub in a test — the
contract `effect_affix.py` already states in as many words (*"so a test — or `--dry-run` — can prove
zero model calls happen"*).

⚠ **The validators are the ALREADY-BUILT distributors, not a second copy of the rules.**
`setgen.distribute.distribute_set` and `charmgen.rules.distribute_charm` each return every violation
with the rule named, which is exactly the shape `make_validate_node` wants: a defect string becomes
the repair prompt. Re-stating any of those rules here would be a second source of truth for
ssot-sets §3.5, which is the failure mode this program keeps writing down.
