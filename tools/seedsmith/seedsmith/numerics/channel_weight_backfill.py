"""seedsmith.numerics.channel_weight_backfill — atom-family-expansion module `tier-bands-coverage`
(docs/architecture/atom-family-expansion/spec-tier-bands-coverage.md).

Closes the historical `tools/FamilyExpandGen -- --check` refusals shaped "no authored sharePermille
for family X (channel stem X not in tier-bands.v1.json)" by computing, from each family's own
`powerBand`, the `channelWeightPermille` entry it lacks today — then handing the result to the
already-built `seedsmith numerics rebalance --set-file ... --publish` CLI (`report/cli.py`) rather
than writing tier-bands.v{n}.json by any other path.

**The formula.** Reuses this project's own single, already-reviewed tier ratio
(`MAGNITUDE_RATIO_PERMILLE = 1750`, imported from `seedsmith.numerics` directly — never a private
copy) as the band-to-band step, anchored so `medium` maps to `1000`, matching `bands.v1.json`'s own
`powerBand.tierMap` ordinal (`trivial=1 .. extreme=5`) and the same `round_legible` both
`FamilyExpansion.cs` and this package's own `formulas.py` already implement identically.

**Known, accepted divergence (spec §6, owner decision 2026-09-08).** This formula reproduces 8 of the
14 already-published `channelWeightPermille` entries (the `medium`-band ones) exactly. The other 6
(`fortitude`/`ferocity`/`resilience`/`mending`, `low`; `bulwark`/`savagery`, `high`) are additively
left untouched even though the formula would compute a different value for them — composing this
band-derived weight with `opWeightPermille`'s own existing discount produces a real, demonstrated bias
(the everyday `Increased` lever gets cut hardest, the deliberately-rarest `More` lever is nearly
unaffected). The owner chose to ship as designed and revisit via telemetry later, matching
`tier-bands.v1.json`'s own stated "not a validated balance decision yet" posture — this module never
overwrites an already-published entry, so that decision is enforced structurally, not just by policy.
