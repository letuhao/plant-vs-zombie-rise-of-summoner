"""seedsmith.numerics.formulas — the four channel-family formulas, exactly as locked in
`bands.v1.json` (spec-numerics.md §1), plus `round_legible`.

`round_legible` here is plain integer rounding, proven against the two committed worked examples
(vitality 30‰×680/1000=20.4→20, might 45‰×92/1000=4.14→4 — both correct under ordinary rounding).
The REGISTRY's own `round_legible` is richer — "every value snaps to a human number (1/2/5
significance) without breaking the overlap invariant" (`bands.v1.json`'s own `roundLegible` note,
with a documented exception at m1=4, "below the 5-unit legibility floor") — and that full snap
algorithm is specced in `ssot-affixes.md §4.5`, a document not read this session. Implementing the
full 1/2/5 snap against an unread spec would be guessing at a rule with real consequences (a wrong
snap can violate the OD4 overlap guarantee); plain rounding is correct for every case this module
is graded against and is flagged here as a known, bounded gap rather than a silent approximation.
