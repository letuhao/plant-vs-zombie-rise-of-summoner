"""seedsmith.corpus.model — Entry, Edge, Corpus.

Three things this module must get right, each learned the hard way building the item corpus
by hand (spec-foundation §1):

- Edges are discovered, not declared — `discover_edges()` takes an id-shaped pattern from
  whichever adapter calls it and records every matching string as an edge, whether or not it
  resolves, so a broken reference is visible rather than silently absent from the graph.
- Minted runtime ids are first-class — `register_minted_ids()` lets a caller tell the corpus
  about ids that exist but were never an entry's own `id` (a milestone-minted atom id, say), so
  `resolves()` consults both.
- Exemplars load but are flagged — `is_exemplar` is true for anything under a top-level
  `_exemplars/` directory; they stay in the graph (so they can themselves be validated) but never
  occupy a slot in a cross-row ledger, a rule a metric can check for by testing this flag.
