"""Prose for every anchor attribute (spec-anchor-contract.md §5) — the reliability mechanism, not
documentation. Each description states what the field means, what distinguishes it from its
nearest neighbour, and an explicit **negative clause**: what the field is *not*. §4.7's finding is
that enum selection is the most bias-prone task shape there is, and the sentence that prevents the
most common error — picking a plausible neighbouring value — is the one saying what the field
excludes.

Edited far more often than schema.py's shape, which is why it lives in its own module (a diff that
mixes prose and structure is unreviewable).

    "gameTypeId": (

    "elementPrimary": (
        "The species' dominant combat element: fire, ice, air, earth, light, or dark. This is the "
