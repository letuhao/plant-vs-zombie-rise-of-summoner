"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.identity.generate_identity — the tree-identity STAGE's own resolution

`adapters.trees.species.generate_codex.resolve_codex_summaries` as closely as a two-field stage
allows: pure result-producing, no persistence of its own — the caller decides where a committed
per-tree identity file lives (`data/seed/passive-tree/identity/<treeId>.json`, per this module's

      shape this session already diagnosed and fixed once today for favour-fit (independent
      free-text generations rarely converge byte-for-byte on a full sentence; a short NAME is a
      different kind of field — closer to a stable identifier — and did converge, including on
      both trees that failed overall). Fix: `name` alone is voted (3-way exact match, the SAME
      proven `codexSummary`-style mechanism); once it resolves, `description` is taken directly
      from the FIRST sample that produced the winning name — guaranteeing the returned pair
      genuinely came from one real, coherent generation together, without requiring three
      independent creative sentences to match exactly.
    * `unresolved` — `{treeId: {"reason": ..., ...}}`: `"name_vote_unresolved"` (name hit a 1-1-1
      split), or `"insufficient_valid_samples"` (fewer than `SAMPLES_PER_TREE` samples ever
      validated).
