"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.review.manual_correction — the ONE sanctioned exception to "a rejection
regenerates, never edits" (task J3, spec-tree-review.md §6.1).

§6.1, restated: *"Nothing here mutates the draft into legality. A draft that broke a rule is
REFUSED with the rule named, because silently repairing it teaches the next call nothing... The one
sanctioned exception exists and keeps its discipline: the `manualCorrection` block, which records
`from` / `to` / `by` / `why`. A hand correction is legal, must be provenance-stamped, and its rate
is itself a metric. Above a declared threshold it means the prompt is wrong and the batch should
have been rejected."*

**Scope, stated rather than assumed.** This module builds the record shape and the rate
computation §6.1 names — both real, both pure, both testable today. It does NOT build a "stamp a
correction onto a committed node" CLI verb or wire a new field onto `NodeSeedRecord`: nothing in
this program has a reviewer surface that would ever CALL such a thing yet (no UI, no CLI verb reads
or writes a correction) — inventing that call site now would be building for a caller that does not
exist, which this repo's own engineering discipline treats as a defect, not diligence. The day a
real reviewer surface exists, it constructs a `ManualCorrection` and calls
`manual_correction_rate_permille` over whatever set it collects — this module is ready for that
caller without needing to change; only the caller is missing, which is a wiring gap
(`CLAUDE.md`'s own rule), never an architectural wall.
