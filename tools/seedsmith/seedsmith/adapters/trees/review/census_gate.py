"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.review.census_gate — the `sheetRead` refusal gate (task H7,
spec-tree-review.md §5.5, §5.6, Success criteria).

**What this module is for, in one sentence.** `trees review --census` must refuse to start
against a lot whose review queue holds no `sheetRead` row, or whose latest row names a
`sheetRevision` other than the one the sheet on disk carries right now. §5.5's own words: *"it
does not prove anyone understood the name-token panel; it proves the sheet for THIS revision was
opened and closed by a named person at a recorded time, and it fails loudly when a reviewer
starts a census against a stale sheet — which is the failure that actually happens."*

**What this module is NOT.** It never renders a sheet, never computes a `sheetRevision`, and
never writes a `sheetRead` row. All three are `web/fusion-rpg-web/scripts/render-tree-cards.mjs`'s
own job (`--sheet` and `--sheet-read` CLI modes) — spec §5.4's "one implementation... not two"
rule applies here exactly as it does to `formatMagnitude`: a second, Python-side sheet renderer
would be a second source of truth for what a reviewer is asked to read. This module only reads
the two committed JSON artifacts that script produces:

  - `<sheetDir>/<lot>/sheet.json` — the sidecar the `--sheet` mode writes beside the committed
    `sheet.html`, carrying the CURRENT `sheetRevision` for that lot.
  - `<reviewDir>/<lot>.json` — the SAME file `appendVerdict` (H6) already writes verdict rows
    into, extended with one more top-level array, `sheetReads`, that the `--sheet-read` mode
    appends to. One file per lot, not a second file format (H7's own resolved ambiguity: the
    alternative was a third file shape, which the spec's own §5.6 "not a second source of truth"
    discipline argues against).

    Two, and only two, refusal reasons — matching the todo's own verification line

    1. **Missing row** — `latest_sheet_read` returns `None`. Nobody has dismissed this lot's sheet
       at all.
    2. **Stale row** — a row exists, but its `sheet_revision` does not match what the sheet on
       disk carries right now. The sheet changed (a new plan, a regenerated corpus, a fixed
       finding) since it was last read, so the old acknowledgment no longer means anything.

    `SheetNotRendered` (no sheet built at all) is allowed to propagate rather than being folded
    into `CensusRefused` — it is a different failure ("nothing to read yet" vs. "read the wrong
    thing"), and collapsing the two would hide which one actually happened.
