"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.review.verdict — the tier-2 acceptance numbers, computed not tabled
(task J2, spec-tree-review.md §3.1, §6.3).

`data/tuning/passive-tree-targets.v2.json`'s own `sampling.acceptanceLadder` already carries the
four `rejectsIn60 -> upperBoundPermille95` rows a human reads — this module is what makes "computed
not tabled" literally true rather than aspirational: `clopper_pearson_upper_bound_permille` is the
real exact one-sided Clopper-Pearson bound (verified against every value in the spec's own §3.1/§6.3
tables), used both to PROVE the committed ladder's four rows agree with the formula (a hand-typed
table can drift; a test that recomputes it cannot) and to resolve the "Hold. Draw 30 more" branch
(§6.3 row 3), whose real n=90 draw has no row of its own in the 60-row ladder at all.

No `scipy` (or any other numeric dependency) — this repo's own `pyproject.toml` already records the
exact debt an undeclared import creates ("D2.3... DECLARED NOWHERE until now — a fresh clone failed
... ModuleNotFoundError"), and scipy is a far heavier, compiled dependency than `jieba` was. The exact
Clopper-Pearson upper bound is instead the smallest `p` solving `BinomialCDF(k; n, p) = alpha` — found
by bisection over `math.comb`'s own exact integer binomial coefficients, pure stdlib, no approximation
beyond ordinary floating-point bisection (200 iterations converges to well under a part-per-billion,
verified against every spec value to 1e-2 already).
