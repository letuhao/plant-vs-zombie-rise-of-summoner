"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.review.sample — the three review tiers (task J2, spec-tree-review.md
§3.2).

Tier 1 (CENSUS): read whole, never sampled — small, high-risk populations.
Tier 2 (CLUSTER SAMPLE): 60 trees, stratified, for the generator's health.
Tier 3 (THIN NODE SAMPLE): ~200 nodes over rare quota cells, catching what a tree-level sample
under-covers by construction.

Tiers 2 and 3 both go through the ALREADY-SHIPPED `seedsmith.sampling.stratified_sample` — **no
second sampler is written** (§3.2's own explicit rule, restated here because it is this module's
central constraint, not a detail). Every draw is seeded from `metric_id + revision`
(`sampling.corpus_revision` or a caller-supplied string), so the same draw is reproducible byte for
byte across two calls — the property a reviewer's own re-read depends on.
