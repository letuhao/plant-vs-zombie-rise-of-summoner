"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.review.diff — the O(diff) incremental re-review pass (task J4,
spec-tree-review.md §8).

"Only the diff is re-reviewed, and node-id stability is what makes that sentence mean anything."
This module compares two snapshots of ONE tree and classifies what changed, per §8's own table.

**Real data checked before writing this, not assumed** — and a real design correction made from
what that check found, not from what seemed reasonable in the abstract. The first draft compared
only `data/seed/passive-tree/nodes/<treeId>.json` (language content — `name`/`flavor`/`affixIds`).
Read directly, `data/generated/passive-tree/<treeId>.json` (`tree-binder`'s own bound output)
carries only `nodeId` and `atoms[].kMicro/kindId/channelId/op/...` — NO content fields at all. This
matters for `"magnitude-retune"` specifically: a retune (`data/tuning/` only) never touches the
language seed, so seed-only diffing can only ever report a retuned node as `"unchanged"` — true, but
not the distinct claim bullet 1 needs ("an EMPTY human queue" is a fact about the review OUTPUT,
provable either way, but "this was a retune" as its own category needs the bound catalog to see).
`content_fields` is therefore a real PARAMETER, not a hardcoded shape: the caller passes
`LANGUAGE_CONTENT_FIELDS` (the default) to diff the seed and get real `"content-changed"`
detection, or `()` to diff the bound catalog and get real `"magnitude-retune"` detection — an empty
field tuple makes `_content_equal` trivially true for any two dicts sharing an id, which is exactly
correct for the bound catalog: nothing else COULD differ there besides a coefficient.
