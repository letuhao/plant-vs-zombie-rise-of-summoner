"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.nodegen.schema — the §6.3 response schema, `audit_schema`-clean by
construction (task H1, spec-tree-language.md §2.1, §6.3, §7 gates 1 and 8).

⛔ **P1, this program's own wording (§2.1): "the language stage can never move a balance number" is
not a policy in this document. It is an unsampleable state, enforced by shipped code.** This module
reuses the SHARED guard rather than forking a program-local copy: `pipeline.model.MAGNITUDE_DENY_NAMES`
already contains `tier`, `rung`, `duration`, `chance`, `cost`, `weight`, `damage`, `hp`, `atk`, plus
any name ending `Milli` — exactly the list §2.1 cites by line number — and `pipeline.model.Pipeline`
already runs `audit_schema` from `__post_init__`, i.e. at construction, before a single field of this
schema is filled. `build_pipeline` below is this module's own construction site: the same act every
other seedsmith pipeline performs, so a numeric field added here fails the exact same way a numeric
field added to `items/setgen/schema.py` or `combogen/schema.py` already does.

Unlike `items/setgen`'s program-specific widened list (`adapters/demons/anchor/audit.py`'s own
`MAGNITUDE_DENY_NAMES`), this schema needs no widened deny-list of its own: none of its seven
required fields (`affixIds`, `affinity`, `exclusion.form`, `exclusion.propertyKeys`, `name`,
`nameKey`, `flavor`) plus the one open-loop field (`rationale`) collide with the shared floor, and
adding one that did would be a P1 violation worth its own review, not a name to allow-list past.

⭐ **Gate 8 — quota conformance is unsampleable, not merely rejected.** `affixIds.items.enum` and
`exclusion.propertyKeys.items.enum` ship EMPTY in the constant below — deliberately, mirroring
`family_propose/prompts.py:63-66` and `items/setgen/schema.py`'s own `threshold_pieces` — and only
`schema_for_call` fills them, from the caller's own permitted subset, `deepcopy`d per call so two
calls in the same process never alias one another's enum (`two_calls_never_alias_one_enum`, spec
Testing strategy). `audit_schema(NODE_RESPONSE_SCHEMA)` therefore audits the SHAPE, never one call's
own snapshot of a quota cell — the same split every other `*_propose` schema in this repo draws.

⚠ **`rationale` — a spec ambiguity resolved here, stated plainly.** §2's ownership table lists
`rationale` as AUTHORED/FREE, "Review queue only. An OPEN-loop field may never gate" — but §6.3's
own illustrative JSON block does not list it among the seven schema properties. Resolved default:
`rationale` IS a schema property, OPTIONAL (never in `required`, never gating), exactly the shape
`pipeline.open_loop.audit_open_loop_schema`'s `VERDICT_FIELD_NAMES` floor already protects against
for a different reason — a free-text field that never becomes a pass/fail is not a P1 hazard, and
omitting it from the schema would silently drop the one place a model can say *why* it picked what
it picked, which the review queue (H2/H6) reads. If a later task finds §6.3's omission was instead
deliberate, dropping this property is a one-line change here, not a redesign.
