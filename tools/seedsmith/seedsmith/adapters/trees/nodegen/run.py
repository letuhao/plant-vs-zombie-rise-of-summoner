"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.nodegen.run — `plan_run` over one tree's committed plan ->
`RunPlan{subjects, held, already_done}` (task H1, spec-tree-language.md §6.1, §6.4); task H2 adds
the real multi-gate RUNNER on top: `generate_node` (one node, base call + the `affixIds` vote) and
`run_language_stage` (a whole tree, idempotent, byte-identical on a forced rerun).

⚠ **What H1 built vs what H2 adds.** H1 assembles the unit-of-work list *deterministically* — one
`Subject` per node, the only unit at which the permitted subset is exact (§6.1's own table) — and
the idempotence ledger's read/write halves. **H2 is the part that actually calls a model**: gates
6-14 (preflight, contract, brief conformance, text style, vote resolution, bounded repair,
persist-time re-gate, idempotence) plus gates 2, 23, 24 (description audit, run verdict, offline
guarantee), wired around H1's own `Subject`/`RunPlan`/ledger rather than replacing them.

**Nothing here reimplements a gate the repo already ships generically** (the todo's own instruction
— reuse, never invent a parallel shape): gate 7 is `actions.validate_heal.gates.run_g1` (schema-
generic, no `atomFamilies`-specific code in it); gate 6 is
`actions.validate_heal.preflight.run_preflight` verbatim; gate 10 is
`workflow.validators.field_echo`/`language` verbatim; gate 11 is
`actions.validate_heal.derive.resolve_set_vote_field`/`verify_permutation` verbatim (`affixIds` is
set-valued, so the SET vote — per-member majority — is the correct aggregation, not the scalar one);
gate 12 is `pipeline.llm_caller.call_with_self_heal` verbatim. Only gate 9's tree-specific half (an
affix outside the permitted set is already a gate-7 enum violation; what gate 7 cannot see is an
affix whose OWN tags collide with this node's anti-motifs) and gate 13 (the persist-time re-gate
over the base response with the VOTED `affixIds` substituted in — a combination gate 7/9 never
checked as a whole, because the vote can pick a set none of the three individual calls returned)
are new code.

**The offline transport stub, precisely.** This module makes no attempt to inject a transport
parameter through `call_with_self_heal` — that function already calls the real
`seedsmith.pipeline.llm_caller.call_model` internally, and the established pattern this whole repo
already uses four times over (`test_classify_pipelines.py`, `test_family_propose.py`,
`test_general_propose.py`, `test_signature_propose.py`) is `unittest.mock.patch
("seedsmith.pipeline.llm_caller.call_model", raising_call)`, where `raising_call(*a, **kw): raise
AssertionError(...)`. §7 gate 24 reuses that exact pattern rather than inventing a second one; the
trees test suite's own copy lives in `_nodegen_fixtures.py` so every test file here shares it.

    unreachable from node generation at all — the corpus metric
    (`PassiveTree/NameCollision`, metrics/passive_tree.py) kept finding 646 real cross-tree
    collisions post-hoc that no per-item check ever rejected. The name is checked against every

    `sorted` is stable, so ties keep the plan's own file order). This exists so

    node the first time it renders — a magnitude node is defined as "makes an EXISTING thing larger"
    (`brief.py`'s own class note), and a tree plan is free to list its magnitude nodes before any
    mechanism node in the same tier (confirmed: `might`'s own committed plan does, for its first six
    nodes) — without this reorder, a magnitude node would ALWAYS render with an empty sibling list
    regardless of how well `run_language_stage` tracks acceptance, which is the exact "current tree is
    empty" gap the 2026-09-06 smoke test surfaced. This does not change what the FINAL seed document's
    own node order is — `run_language_stage`'s own `sorted_records = sorted(..., key=... node_id)`

    prompt-version re-roll expressible through the real CLI at all (until now the only caller of

    """One tree, start to finish, idempotent. §7 gate 14: a subject already in the ledger is never
    regenerated — its ALREADY-ACCEPTED record is read back from the ledger and reused, so a forced
    rerun over unchanged inputs makes zero model calls and re-emits byte-identical bytes (the
    historical defect this whole task exists to catch: "the commander-effect generator rewrote all
    84 entries every run").

    **`supersede_stale` (2026-09-11, §8's provenance-supersede pass, J4's production path).** With
    it, a ledger row whose per-record `promptVersion` is absent (pre-provenance vintage) or
    different from the current `brief.PROMPT_VERSION` is planned for generation AND listed in
    `RunPlan.superseded`; its acceptance goes through `record_superseded` (prior row preserved
    under `supersededRecord`), never `record_accepted`'s raise-on-duplicate. A row already carrying
    the current vintage is left alone. This is what makes a prompt-version re-roll expressible
    through the real CLI at all — until now `record_superseded`'s only caller was a unit test.

    **Tree-wide sibling tracking (§6.2, closed 2026-09-06, widened same day).** This function, not
    `inputs_for`, owns "already-accepted siblings" — populating it needs `records`/`done`, data only
    this loop holds. Whatever `siblings` the caller's own `inputs_for(subject)` sets is REPLACED with
    the real, freshly-tracked tuple (via `dataclasses.replace`); a caller is never expected to track
    this itself. The pool is seeded from resumed (`plan.already_done`) records too, so a resumed run's
    first newly-generated node still sees whatever an EARLIER run already accepted, not just what this
    call accepts. **Tree-wide, not tier-scoped** — widened from the original per-tier design the same
    day a real run proved tier-scoping insufficient for its own stated "do not repeat" purpose (a
    real, independent three-way name collision across two different tiers) — capped to the most
    recent `_TREE_SIBLING_CAP` (12) accepted nodes, matching §6.2's own "k nearest siblings" language
    rather than passing an ever-growing, unbounded list as the tree fills in. Combined with
    `plan_run`'s own mechanism-before-magnitude ordering, a magnitude node normally has at least one
    real sibling to read by the time it renders, rather than always seeing brief.py's own "(none yet)"
    placeholder.

    **`max_workers` (owner request, 2026-09-06): batched parallelism, not blanket parallelism.**
    `plan.subjects` is already grouped into contiguous `(tier, node_class)` runs by `plan_run`'s own
    ordering — every subject in ONE such run shares the identical siblings snapshot (none of them can
    be a sibling of another in the SAME run; siblings only ever come from an EARLIER run), so they have
    no dependency on each other and are safe to generate concurrently. Runs themselves stay STRICTLY
    SEQUENTIAL — a later run must see everything an earlier one accepted, which is the whole point of
    §6.2's sibling pass. `max_workers=1` (the default) takes the single-subject-at-a-time path
    unconditionally, byte-for-byte the same code as before this parameter existed — every existing
    caller and test keeps its exact prior behavior with zero change. `max_workers>1` fans out within a
    run via a bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor`, mirroring `workflow.runner.MAX_WORKERS=4`'s own stated
    rationale ("one local model serves one request at a time; a small pool keeps it fed without
    stampeding it") — `workflow.runner.run_many` itself cannot be reused here, since it is built around
    a LangGraph `app.invoke()` interface this module never adopted. Outcomes are always reassembled in
    `plan.subjects`' own original order before being returned, regardless of which worker in a run
    finished first, so `result.outcomes` is deterministic either way.
