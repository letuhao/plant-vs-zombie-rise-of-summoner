"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.nodegen.quota — `largest_remainder_count` over the six quota axes,
plus **H3's own addition**: the per-slot cell walk, hard-constraint overrides and the step-5
rebalance (task H3, spec-tree-language.md §4, spec-tree-plan.md §8).

**What H1 built.** §4.2's algorithm has seven steps; steps 1-3 and 6 are pure apportionment
arithmetic with no dependency on a specific tree's plan, and were real from the start:

- step 1: `N` is read off the loaded plan's own `len(nodes)`, never hardcoded to 1,560 — correct
  at today's real corpus size (one committed tree, `might`) and at the eventual 39-tree corpus
  alike (see `quota_for_plan`'s own docstring)
- step 2: `axis_marginals` — exact integer marginals per axis, `Σ == N`, via the SHARED
  `largest_remainder_count` (`adapters.actions.distribution_planner.derive`) — reused, not
  reimplemented, per this module's own spec footnote naming that exact function by file:line
- step 3: `expand_counts` — the same shared function, re-exported here so a caller never has to
  reach across two adapter packages to flatten one allocation
- step 6: `permitted` — narrows a vocabulary to the ids matching one `QuotaCell`'s value on one
  axis; this is the "load-bearing line" the spec's own Code style section shows verbatim, and this
  module's version matches it

**What H3 adds: steps 4 and 5, and the plan-facing wiring around them.**

- Step 4 — `build_slot`/`assign_quota_cells`: the per-slot walk assigning a `QuotaCell` to every
  one of a tree's node slots, in the caller's own canonical (tree, branch, tier, index) order.
  **`nodeClass` is a hard override on EVERY slot, not only an elemental/status tree's** — B1's own
  archetype mechanism ramp (`plan.archetypes.mechanism_nodes`) already fixes it per node before
  this stage ever runs (`plan_read.TreePlanNode.node_class`), so this axis is never drawn from a
  free sequence at all; `element`/`status` are forced only for an elemental/status tree
  (spec-tree-plan.md §8 step 4's own two category overrides). `trigger`, `channelFamily` and
  `exclusionForm` are never overridden — every slot draws them freely.
- Step 5 — `rebalance_axis`: returns an overridden slot's drawn value to the pool by SUBTRACTING
  the forced tally from the axis's own corpus-wide quota (both were computed over the SAME total,
  so the residual sums out exactly — see the function's own docstring for why no second
  `largest_remainder_count` pass is needed) — and refuses (`OverdrawnQuota`), rather than silently
  clamping or borrowing, the moment a forced value's own demand exceeds what the targets file ever
  allocated it. That refusal is H3's own acceptance bullet: "an overdrawn cell is refused, not
  rebalanced silently."
- `quota_for_plan`/`permitted_ids_for_cell` — the plan-facing convenience wrapper: reads a real
  `plan_read.TreePlan`'s own `property_vocabulary` for every axis's member list (already counted
  fresh by B1 from the real mirrors — never a second roster read here) and `nodegen.targets
  .PassiveTreeTargets` for the declared weights, so a caller never hand-assembles `quota`/`order`
  itself.
