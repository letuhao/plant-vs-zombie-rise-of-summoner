"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.species.generate_favour_fit — the favour-fit STAGE's own resolution
function (task J8, spec-species-tree.md §3.1 step 3). §3.1's own four steps, restated against this
function's real inputs: step 1 (`species.plan.assign_favour_cells`'s quota) and step 2 (the same
call's per-species cell + alternates) already happened before this function is ever called; THIS
function is step 3 — "the call receives ONE cell, its alternates, and the species' own lore, and
answers ONE question: does this favour fit, and if not, which of these alternates does?"

**One graph PER SPECIES, not one shared graph** — a real, structural difference from
`generate_codex.resolve_codex_summaries`'s own shared-graph shape. The codex-summary schema is
IDENTICAL for every species (free text, same max length); the favour-fit schema's own `enum` is
built FRESH per species from THAT species' own alternates (`schemas.favour_fit_schema`, gate 8's
own per-call discipline) — two species never share an enum, so they can never share a graph either.
3-way voted via `resolve_vote` over the small `choice` enum (`"offered"` / an alternate key /
`"none"`) — the SAME machinery every other voted scalar field in this program already uses.

      the RESOLVED `FavourCell` object (the offered one, or the winning alternate) — never a bare
      string a caller would have to re-look-up, since the caller already handed this function the
      exact `FavourCell` instances it is choosing among.

      `"insufficient_valid_samples"` (fewer than `SAMPLES_PER_SPECIES` samples ever validated), or
      `"none_of_the_offered_favours_fit"` — the vote resolved to the literal `"none"` answer, which
      §3.1 step 3 names as a LEGITIMATE outcome, never a failure: this species' favour lock could
      not be assigned from its own offered options and belongs in the review queue as `unresolved`
      (spec-species-tree.md §3.1/§4's own success criterion — the SAME `unresolved` concept
      `UnresolvedCountMetric`'s own `mechanicalFavour` subject, task J5, already gates on).
    * `results` — the per-sample-state graph outcome, keyed by the sample's own subject id, pooled
