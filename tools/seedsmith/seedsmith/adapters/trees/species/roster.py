"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.species.roster — the species roster reader (task J5,
spec-species-tree.md §2.1, §4).

**The blind spot this must not inherit, stated with the real file that proves it exists today.**
`tools/DemonQualityReport/Program.cs:77` skips any file beginning with `_`, so it never sees
`data/seed/demons/species/zombie/_needs-review.json` — which, checked directly against the real
committed corpus while writing this module (2026-09-07), STILL holds a live conflict: `SnorkleZombie`
is indexed at `zombie/undead.json` (the current, corrected copy — `aptitudePrimary: "Onslaught"`) but
`_needs-review.json` ALSO defines a `SnorkleZombie` entry (a stale draft, `confidence.
aptitudePrimary: "unresolved"`), parked, never resolved, invisible to any tool applying the `_` skip.
This is not a hypothetical: `load_roster()` below raises on the real repo state for exactly this
reason, and the raise is correct — the parked entry is a genuine unresolved duplicate, not a false
positive to special-case away.

Two rules from §2.1, both load-bearing:

1. The roster is read from `_index.json` (a flat `{speciesId: relativeFilePath}` map — checked
   directly against the real file: 904 keys today, not the spec's own 2026-09-05 count of 840; the
   count is NEVER hardcoded here, only ever `len(index)`), and every `.json` file under the species
   root is walked WITHOUT the `_`-prefix skip. A species id present on disk but not indexed, indexed
   under a path other than where it is actually defined, or defined in more than one file, HALTS the
   run naming every conflicting path — never "pick the first one."
2. `_index.json` itself is excluded from the walk by NAME (it is the manifest, not a species content
   file), never by the underscore convention — so a future `_index-v2.json` or similar would still be
   walked as content rather than silently assumed to be another manifest.
