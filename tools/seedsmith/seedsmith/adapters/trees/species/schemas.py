"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.species.schemas — the response schemas task J8 needs beyond the shared
generic node schema (spec-species-tree.md §6, §7.1). Two schemas, both `audit_schema`-clean by
construction, matching `nodegen/schema.py`'s own "no numeric field, proven at `Pipeline.__post_init__`,
before a call is made" discipline exactly (reused, never forked):

- **`CODEX_SUMMARY_RESPONSE_SCHEMA`** — §6's own `codexSummary` field: AUTHORED, ≤140 chars, no
  numbers, no mechanics jargon. The schema audit (`audit_schema`) only proves the SHAPE carries no
  numeric field; it cannot see whether a GENERATED SENTENCE itself smuggles a digit or a channel id
  as prose (a schema has no opinion on string CONTENT). `codex_summary_defects` is the separate,
  content-level check §6's own Testing-strategy row names
  (`codexSummary_carries_no_number_and_no_channel_id`) — run on the model's own answer, after a call,
  never a substitute for the schema audit that runs before one.
- **`FAVOUR_FIT_RESPONSE_SCHEMA`** — §3.1 step 3's own brief contract: the stage receives ONE cell,
  its alternates, and the species' own lore, and answers ONE question — does the offered cell fit,
  and if not, which alternate does (or none of them)? The schema's own enum is filled PER CALL from
  that species' own offered options (gate 8's own "quota conformance is unsampleable, not merely
  rejected" pattern, `nodegen/schema.py`'s own `schema_for_call`), so the model can never answer with
  a cell that was not actually offered to it — the 166× fix, structural rather than validated after
  the fact.

The generic NODE schema itself is reused verbatim (`nodegen.schema.NODE_RESPONSE_SCHEMA`) — §1's own
table states species trees inherit the node record unchanged, so this module does not re-declare it.
