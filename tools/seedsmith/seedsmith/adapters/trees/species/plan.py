"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.species.plan — the mechanical-favour lock (task J5,
spec-species-tree.md §3, §4). Pure, deterministic, model-free: no model call, no file I/O, matching
`adapters.actions.distribution_planner.derive`'s own style (the spec's own Code style section names
that module as the mould).

**D17's lock, and why it needs its own arithmetic rather than reusing `nodegen.quota`'s six axes.**
`nodegen.quota` apportions ONE tree's own 40 nodes across six per-tree content axes (nodeClass,
trigger, element, status, channelFamily, exclusionForm) — a different question from the one here,
which apportions the WHOLE 904-species corpus across the cross product of THREE axes (aptitude,
element, status) that together form a species' mechanical-favour LOCK. `element` and `status` are
axis NAMES that exist in both places for unrelated reasons — a species tree's own node-level element
quota (which element a given node's atom is tagged with) has nothing to do with which element that
species' WHOLE TREE mechanically favours — so nothing here imports `nodegen.quota`'s axis machinery,
to avoid conflating the two.

**`legitimateSkew` (D32) is generic and, as of this module, has its first real consumer.**
`adapters.trees.targets.PassiveTreeTargets.legitimate_skew_rows` already parses and validates
`data/tuning/passive-tree-targets.v2.json`'s `legitimateSkew.rows` (checked directly: shipped empty,
`[]`, as of 2026-09-07) — nothing in the repo has ever read a non-empty one. A row's `axis` is a free
string, so the SAME mechanism the quotas file already ships doubles as this module's own "earth may
run to roughly 1.5× uniform" declaration point (§3.2), keyed `axis: "aptitude" | "element" | "status"`
— no new tuning-file schema, no `publish.py` rebalance, needed for D32's target to be expressible.

**Why `weightsMilli` is DERIVED here rather than read as a literal JSON table** (the spec's own §
Code style block writes `targets["mechanicalFavour"]["weightsMilli"]` as if it already exists): the
joint space is 12 aptitudes × 6 elements × 24 statuses = 1,728 cells. Hand-authoring 1,728 per-mille
numbers summing to exactly 1000 is not a balance surface a person edits — it is a MECHANICAL
consequence of three small, real numbers a person WOULD edit: each axis's own near-uniform weights
(`uniform` by default, the same as `nodegen.quota`'s own four uniform-scheme axes) plus whichever
`legitimateSkew` rows exist. `mechanical_favour_weights_milli` computes the 1,728-cell table from
those three axis tables at call time, and IS the concrete, inspectable artifact the spec's pseudocode
refers to — just derived, not hand-typed, matching this repo's own "no axis lists its own members in
a tuning file" rule (`plan/vocabulary.py`'s module docstring) extended to this axis triple too.

This module also departs from the spec's own illustrative `targets: Mapping[str, Any]` parameter
type in favour of the REAL, already-shipped `PassiveTreeTargets` (a loaded, validated dataclass) —
matching `nodegen.quota.axis_weights_milli`'s own real signature, not the spec's loose shorthand —
so the mechanical-favour weights are derived from the SAME typed, "a missing key raises" object every
other tree quota already reads, rather than a second raw-dict view of the same file.
