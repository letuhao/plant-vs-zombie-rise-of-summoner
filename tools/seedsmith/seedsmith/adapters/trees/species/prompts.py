"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.species.prompts — the codex-summary and favour-fit briefs (task J8,
spec-species-tree.md §3.1 step 3, §6).

**Why the codex brief hands the model the mechanical favour triple directly, in full, rather than a
softened paraphrase**: §6's own contract is *"what building into this bloodline rewards, in the
player's words"* — the model's whole job is the TRANSLATION from mechanism to player language, so
withholding the mechanism would leave it guessing at the very thing it is meant to translate. The
system prompt is what forbids the mechanical vocabulary from leaking into the OUTPUT; the input is
allowed, even expected, to be exact.

**The favour-fit brief is the one real judgement call D17 locks against an open enum**: the model
never picks a favour freely — it only ever answers "does the offered one fit, does one of these few
alternates fit instead, or does none of them" (§3.1 step 3's own wording, quoted verbatim in the
brief below), and `schemas.favour_fit_schema` makes every other answer structurally unsampleable.
