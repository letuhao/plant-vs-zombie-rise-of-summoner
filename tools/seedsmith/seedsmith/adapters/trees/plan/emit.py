    real differences investigated and resolved before writing this, not guessed:

    1. **`ordinal` and `mechanical_favour` are CALLER-supplied, never read from a roster here.**
       Every sibling factory above reads its OWN roster internally (`plan.vocabulary.load_roster`),
       a sibling foundational module. The species roster (`species.roster.load_roster`) is a
       narrow, species-only package that must never become a dependency of this foundational one
       (used by every tree category) — the opposite direction from every other dependency in this
       program. So the caller (the species-tree orchestration, which already sits above both
       modules) resolves the species roster's own position and the favour lock, and hands both in.
    2. **`gate_quantity` reuses `aptitudePoints`' own evidence row, with a real, checked caveat
       recorded here rather than silently assumed.** §8.1's own investigation: specimen level (the
       quantity) is live and `AllocationScope.UniqueDemon` (the scope) is declared and rate-loaded,
       but "the caller that binds the two is ABSENT" — nothing in `src/` passes `UniqueDemon` to
       `PointBudget.PointsFor`/`CheckScope`. `data/seed/passive-tree/gate-evidence.v1.json`'s own
       `aptitudePoints` row cites `PointBudget.PointsFor(AllocationScope.Commander, ...)` as its
       evidence — Commander, not UniqueDemon — so reusing that row's `"carrier"` state here is
       REUSING evidence that does not, strictly, cover this scope. §8.1 explicitly reasons this is
       SAFE regardless ("generating the species corpus early does not strand it... only on a
       binding whose twin already ships") and just as explicitly assigns fixing the binding itself
       to `tree-state`, not this module — so this function does not add a new `gateIndexKind` row
       to the governed evidence file (that file's own hand-edit rule requires naming a real shipped
       carrier line, and `UniqueDemon`'s does not exist yet); it reuses the existing kind, with
       this paragraph as the disclosed reason why that is the correct scope of what J8 owns.

    Raises `ValueError` if any of the favour triple's three members is empty — never a silent
    partial lock (the same "refuse, don't guess" discipline the sibling factories already apply to
