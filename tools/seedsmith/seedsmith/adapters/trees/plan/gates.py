"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.plan.gates — R-G1's checked-in evidence row (spec-tree-plan.md §7,
§7.1, task C2).

**The planner never resolves whether a `gateQuantity` has a production carrier.** It reads one
committed file, `data/seed/passive-tree/gate-evidence.v1.json`, that names the state
(`carrier` | `pending`) per `gateIndexKind` — never per tree, never per individual `gateQuantity`
instance. A tree's own `gateQuantity` string still varies per roster entry
(`aptitude.Might@Commander` vs `aptitude.Ferocity@Commander`), but its STATE is shared by every
tree of the same `gateIndexKind`, which is exactly why the evidence file is keyed by kind: the day
`gate-counters` lands `element_mastery`'s counter, ONE row here flips and every elemental tree's
`gateState` changes with it — "one evidence row moves and 240 nodes become generable without a
spec edit" (spec-tree-plan.md §7.1).

`resolve_gate_state` is the ONLY function anywhere in this program allowed to turn a
`gateIndexKind` into a `gateState`. A `TreeSpec` builder (e.g. `emit.might_tree_spec`) must call it
— never hand-write `"carrier"` or `"pending"` as a literal, which is the exact defect this module
exists to close.
