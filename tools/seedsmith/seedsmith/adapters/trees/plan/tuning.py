"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.plan.tuning — the Python reader over `data/tuning/passive-tree.v1.json`
(task B1). A1 built the C# side (`PassiveTreeTuning.cs`) for the RPG runtime; `tree-plan` is a
Python/seedsmith module and needs its own typed view of the same file — same `_require` mould as
`adapters.items.setgen.tuning` and `adapters.trees.targets`, deliberately NOT shared code with the
C# loader (different languages, same file, same discipline).

Only the keys `tree-plan` itself owns (spec-tree-plan.md §Tunables) are read here. `tree-binder`'s,
`tree-state`'s and `tree-resolve`'s keys live in the same file but are that module's concern when
their own Python readers (if any) land.
