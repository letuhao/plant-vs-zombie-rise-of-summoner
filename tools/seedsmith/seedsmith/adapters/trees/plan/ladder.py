"""seedsmith.adapters.trees.plan.ladder — the tier ladder and the budget column
(spec-tree-plan.md §2-3, task B1).

`req(t)` gates on APTITUDE POINTS (R1/R-G0), never skill points — a different currency from
`tree-state`'s unlock cost. `W(T)` is the cumulative tree power at tier `T`, linear per tier (D20's
pairing rule). Every value here is an exact integer: `t(t+1)` is a product of consecutive integers
and therefore always even, so `k*t(t+1)//2` has no remainder for any integer `k` — no rounding ever
enters the aptitude ladder.

The budget column and the per-node split DO round (per-mille of one branch budget cannot divide
evenly in general) — both use the same "round half up, residual to the LAST slot" rule, verified
digit-for-digit against spec-tree-plan.md §3's own worked tables for all three shipped archetypes
before this module was written (never assume a derivation matches worked examples — check it).
