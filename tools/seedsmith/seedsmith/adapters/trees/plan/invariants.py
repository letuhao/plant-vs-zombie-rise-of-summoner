offender").

verified against the spec's worked tables — it composes their pure functions into the checks the
Testing table names, and adds the two formulas (`derive_max_node_share_milli`, the milli/points
conversion residual rule) those checks need that were not owned by any existing module.

    absorbed by the LAST slot"). At `tier_count=10` (the shipped topology) that residual is exactly

    `tier_count=23` first. It never manifests today because `topology.tierCount` is structural and
    "Ask first" to change (Boundaries, spec-tree-plan.md) and is fixed at 10, where the residual is
    0. `check_tree_equal_value` therefore scopes its own P-2 call to the corpus's ACTUAL emitted

    §7.1's own worked table additionally stages the two currently-PENDING categories (`elemental`,
    `status`) into separate waves 1/2, by which `gate-counters` row is expected to land first. That
    finer staging is a scheduling OPINION about two quantities that are both `pending` today (D37)
    — it is not a fact `gateState` itself carries, since `gateState` cannot distinguish one pending
    reason from another. Reproducing it here would mean reading something other than `gateState`
    (e.g. a hand-ordered category list), which is precisely what R-G2 forbids ("never
    hand-assigned"). This function instead honours the property R-G2 actually names: the day
    `gate-counters` lands `element_mastery`, that tree's own `gateState` flips to `carrier` and it
    moves to wave 0 the same day, with no spec edit and no wave renumbering elsewhere — resolved
    ambiguity, see the C2 task report."""
