"""seedsmith.adapters.base — the interface a feature implements to be understood by the core
(spec-foundation §2, field definitions per §7.2).

`LegalityFn` returning `True` unconditionally is a trap: an adapter that forgets to encode real
illegal combinations turns every genuinely-illegal pair into a permanent false Coverage finding
(spec-analytics §2.2). It is a required method, not an optional one with a safe-looking default,
and `adapters._stub` exercises a real `False` case so the trap cannot go unnoticed.
