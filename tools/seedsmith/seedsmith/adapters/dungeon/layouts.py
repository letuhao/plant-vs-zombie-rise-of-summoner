"""Layout template content (D4.30's own real prerequisite chain; spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md
§1.3, `dungeon-layout`'s own budget row: *"Model-free, planner-emitted directly from
`dungeon.v1.json` bands -- no call, no budget row needed beyond this placeholder"*).

**Real drift found and fixed before any content shipped, not trusted from the spec's own prose**:
`spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md`:76 cites `widthBand` as `narrow · regular · broad`, but the real,
committed `data/seed/dungeon/_registry/bands.v1.json`'s own `widthBand` band is
`narrow · mid · wide` — confirmed by reading the registry file directly, not assumed from the doc.
`schema.py`'s own `build_layout_schema` reads `reg["bands"]["widthBand"]`, so the REGISTRY is the
real contract; this module follows it, not the spec's stale prose.

Every field on a layout anchor is PLANNED (`schema.py`'s `LAYOUT_OWNERSHIP`, confirmed empty of
AUTHORED/VALIDATED members) -- there is no model call to make and no vote to resolve. This module
is the whole of `dungeon-layout`'s own generation: a small, hand-reasoned set of templates spanning
the real band space, minted and emitted exactly like a model-authored corpus would be, just without
a model in the loop.

**Why six, not the full 3x3x3x3x3x3x(2^3-1) combinatorial space**: the budget row's own "no cells"
framing means there is no coverage metric demanding exhaustive enumeration (unlike room/event/quest/
encounter). Six templates give real, reasoned variety across every one of the eight fields --
every value of `sizeBand`/`widthBand`/`branchiness` appears at least once, every value of the three
density bands appears at least once, and `raidModes` narrows from `[solo, pair]` at the simplest
template to `[quad]` at the most complex one, matching the real gameplay shape ("a bigger, more
tangled graph asks for more coordination, not less").
