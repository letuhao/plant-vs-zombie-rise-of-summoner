"""D1.10 (spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md §1, "Pipelines with permuted enums and majority vote") --
the boundary. `call` is always injected, never imported directly, matching every other pipeline in
this program (`items/uniques/pipelines.py`'s own established contract): a test proves zero real
model calls happen on a schema-only or dry-run path.

**Quest votes THREE fields, not one -- a real difference from the uniques pipeline, not an
oversight.** `spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md` §1.5's own field table marks `name`, `countBand` AND
`rewardBand` all "AUTHORED, voted" (uniques votes only `name`). `countBand`/`rewardBand` are
abstract MECHANICAL parameters with no narrative coupling to `flavor` -- unlike a unique's
`baseType`, voting them independently of which sample's `name` won carries no "recombined,
incoherent flavor" risk (`items/uniques/pipelines.py`'s own documented reason for keeping a
winning sample's other fields together). `flavor` stays tied to whichever sample's `name` won the
vote, since it IS narrative prose about that specific name.

    independent, `EncounterCoverage.cs`'s own real coverage key), cycled deterministically per
    sibling slot index within a cell so two siblings are NEVER assigned the same shape unless the
    caller's own `planned_ids_by_cell` asks for more entries in one cell than that formation's real
    ceiling can express (a caller error `planner.allocate_encounter_targets` exists specifically to
    prevent). `_SLOT_ITEM_SCHEMA`'s own doc comment has the schema-side half of this story.

    `rankOrder` still gets its own structural quality check (JSON Schema's `uniqueItems` alone
    cannot express "covers the full range", only "no duplicates among whatever was listed") and
    `threatWindow` its own ordinal-inversion check (`_threatWindow_problems`, a SEPARATE real defect
    a live smoke test caught) -- both real model choices, retried in the SAME bounded loop
    `run_event_draws` established, since neither showed the severe, un-retry-able bias posture did.

    No motif brief here, unlike event: `kinds.py`'s own `motif_expression` for this kind is "the
    shape of the opposition, never which species fill it" -- an abstract design register the brief
    conveys in prose (`build_encounter_brief`), not a literal-word constraint `motif_coverage` could
    check against.

    **Name collision retry, added after the posture fix shipped 40/40 but a canonical-word scan
    measured 24/40 (60%) sharing a name with a sibling** -- a real rate, WORSE than event's own
    measured 10%: encounter's `name` has less to differentiate on than event's own theme-grounded
    motifs (formation/elementSpread/posture are generic, repeatable concepts -- "Swarming
    Skirmishers" is a natural name for almost any `pack` cell). The SAME `used_names`/
    `canonical_words` mechanism `run_event_draws`/`run_room_draws` already established.
