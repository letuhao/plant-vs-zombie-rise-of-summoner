"""The dungeon planner (D1.9, spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md §4) — model-free, runs first.

**Built here:** cell enumeration from the adapter's own legality function (§3.6's (kind, climate)
rule), id minting from a high-water mark (§1's "every id is PLANNED... the planner mints
`<kind>.<cell>-<nnn>` from the cell and a sequence that continues from the high-water mark"), and
(2026-09-07) the motif-brief allocator (§4 step 2) — see the three functions below.

**Built 2026-09-07, previously deferred as needing a registry that turned out to already exist:**
`select_planning_themes`/`allocate_event_targets`/`motif_brief_for_slot` — D1.10's own same-day
correction found `data/seed/demons/_registry/themes.v1.json` (84 rows) already shipped and wired
into `adapters/dungeon/registries.py`'s `load_themes()`, which is what this module's own docstring
was waiting on ("needs a dungeon motif registry that does not exist yet").

**Still deliberately deferred, named rather than hidden:** the Hopcroft-Karp feasibility check
(§4 step 5 — `seedsmith.planner.feasibility.check_feasibility` already exists generically and is
the right tool once real slot-demand data exists to feed it) — a wiring gap against ALREADY-BUILT
shared infrastructure (`seedsmith/planner/feasibility.py`, `seedsmith/planner/demand.py`), not a
missing algorithm.
