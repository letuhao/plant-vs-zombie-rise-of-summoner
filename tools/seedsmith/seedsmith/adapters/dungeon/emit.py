"""Canonical dungeon anchor serialisation and emission (D1.11, spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md §6).
**One object per file** — unlike the creatures anchor's per-family list — so `data/seed/dungeon/
<directory>/<id>.json` holds exactly one entry, plus one `_index.json` per directory
(`id -> filename`) for O(1) lookup without a full-tree load.

`write_entry`/`write_corpus` now accept an optional provenance mapping (`seedsmith-content-
standard` Task 12) — the real, precise fix for the wiring gap `spec-content-completeness-
dungeon.md` §2 names: this writer previously had no way to attach `_provenance` at all, which is
WHY no committed dungeon content ever carried the field despite `provenance.py`'s own
`DungeonProvenance`/`stale_ids` existing as real code (that module's own staleness-key SHAPE is
kept as documentation of dungeon's richer audit fields; the staleness KEY itself is computed via
`build_provenance` below, reusing `pipeline/staleness.py`'s shared `staleness_key` — the one thing
`content-completeness-core` says every domain must agree on, not re-derive). Optional and additive:
every existing call (the idempotency test's own real usage) that passes no provenance is byte-for-
byte unaffected.
