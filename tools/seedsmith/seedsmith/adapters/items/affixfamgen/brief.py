"""seedsmith.adapters.items.affixfamgen.brief — partition context + the model-facing brief.

⛔ **P1, unamended, same as `setgen/brief.py`'s own opening line: the model writes identity, code
resolves every number.** The brief hands the model exactly four choices — a short mechanical
`word` (never a display word, per `naming.v1.json`'s own family-id rule), `channel` (constrained to
the partition's own already-used channels — see "Why channel is closed to the partition" below),
`roles`, and `tags`. It never sees a tier, a magnitude, an `amount`, or a power-band NUMBER (only
the closed `powerBand` enum word, which `bands.v1.json` itself defines as "what an author writes
INSTEAD of a magnitude"). The tier-band curve numerics are resolved afterwards, deterministically,
by `seedsmith.numerics` — never invented by a call.

**`kindId` is a caller input, never a model choice.** The spec's own "Ask first" boundary: whether
a NEW family should target `stat.modify` or `stat.derived` is a real design choice with downstream
consequences (module 5's two delivery paths) — this brief refuses to let the model pick it, the
same way `setgen`'s own charm brief fixes `charmClass`'s legality before the call rather than
asking the model to reason about ssot-charms itself.

**Why `channel` is closed to the partition's own already-used channels, not the full closed
vocabulary.** `AtomKindRegistry.cs` names two real per-kind channel vocabularies: `PrimaryChannels`
(a small, fixed set of real game channels for `stat.modify`, e.g. `atk`/`maxHp`/`hp`/`defense`/
`arm1Max`/`arm2Max`) and `DerivedChannels` (267+ registered derived channels for `stat.derived`).
Every real "NEW family" entry actually shipped in `data/seed/items/affix-families/*.json` reuses a
channel a SIBLING family in the same partition already uses, on a different `op` — `atom.life-graft`
reuses `hp` (already used by `mending`'s `Flat`); `atom.arm-hardening` reuses `defense` (already
used by `warding`/`resilience`); `atom.prec-fixation` reuses `combat.accuracy.{variant}` (already
used by `precision`). No shipped NEW family invents a channel absent from its own partition. This
module follows that real, observed pattern rather than re-transcribing either 8-or-14-entry
`PrimaryChannels` list or the 267-entry `DerivedChannels` list a second time in Python (which
`opvocab.py`'s own docstring explains is the reason C# vocabularies get transcribed with citation,
not casually re-derived): the brief offers only the partition's own existing channels, so a
generated family's channel is always a real, already-registered one by construction. Authoring a
family on a channel NEW to its partition is therefore explicitly out of this module's scope, not a
silent limitation — a real future need would extend this brief to accept an explicit allow-list
from the C# vocabulary, not lift the constraint unconditionally.

Choose, and nothing else:
1. `word` — a SHORT MECHANICAL identifier, not a display word (`naming.v1.json`'s own family-id
   rule: family ids are mechanical, distinct from the flavour vocabulary). The full id will be
   minted as `atom.{self.partition.stem}-{{word}}`.
2. `channel` — one of this partition's own already-registered channels:
   {existing}
   A channel not in this list is out of scope for this brief; do not invent one.
3. `op` — one of {legal_ops}, and it must not repeat a (channel, op) pair this partition already
   ships (listed above per channel).
4. `roles` — one or more of the closed role vocabulary below.
5. `tags` — one or more of the closed tag vocabulary below.
6. `powerBand` — one of {self.power_bands} (a RELATIVE category, never a number — bands.v1.json's
   own words for "what an author writes instead of a magnitude").
7. `name`, `nameKey`, `displayTemplate`.

Never choose a number, an amount, a tier or a per-mille value. Those are resolved after you answer,
by `seedsmith.numerics`, from the tier-band curve — never from this call.
