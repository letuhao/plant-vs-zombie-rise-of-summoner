"""seedsmith.adapters.items.affixfamgen.opvocab — the ONE place that knows the real, closed
op-per-atom-kind vocabulary this generator may ever emit (spec-affix-families-gen.md, Acceptance
#3 and "Code style").

**Transcribed with citation, not hand-guessed, and not re-derived a second time anywhere else in
this package.** There is no JSON export of `AtomKindRegistry.cs`'s per-kind op enum to read
programmatically from Python — the same situation `adapters.items.channels` already documents for
`BattleRuleset`'s formulas ("there is no JSON export of that C# class to read instead"). This
module follows that exact precedent: copy the real values, cite the exact lines, and let a test
assert the shipped seed corpus (`data/seed/items/affix-families/*.json`) never uses an op outside
what is transcribed here — so a future registry change that silently drifts is caught by the
corpus itself disagreeing with this table, not by trusting the transcription forever.

Real evidence, read directly from `src/FusionRpg.Core/Effects/Atoms/AtomKindRegistry.cs`:

- `stat.modify` (line ~494-521): `ParamDef("op", ...)` carries no `Vocabulary` declaration, but the
  kind's own doc string (line 517) states plainly "Ops are Flat|Increased|More — effects cannot
  emit Override", and `Validate()` (line 349-357) explicitly REJECTS `op == "Override"`
  (case-insensitive) with that exact reasoning ("it has no revert path; a permanent Override would
  leak"). Three legal ops: `Flat`, `Increased`, `More`.
- `stat.derived` (line ~523-583): same shape, no `Vocabulary` on `op`, but the kind's own doc
  string (line 582) states "Derived ops are Flat|Increased|Replace|Flag; there is no More on the
  derived side." Four legal ops: `Flat`, `Increased`, `Replace`, `Flag`.

Real, shipped seed content confirms the exact casing used on disk (PascalCase, not lowercase):
`data/seed/items/affix-families/g-attack.json` uses `"op": "Flat"` / `"Increased"` / `"More"` for
three `stat.modify` entries; `data/seed/items/affix-families/g-precision.json` uses `"Flat"` /
`"Replace"` / `"Flag"` for `stat.derived` entries. The spec's own Acceptance #3 prose spells the
vocabulary in lowercase (`flat`/`increased`/`replace`/`flag`, `flat`/`increased`/`more`) — this is
the spec's own shorthand for the SET, not the literal on-disk casing; this module treats the
comparison as case-insensitive (matching `AtomKindRegistry.Validate`'s own `OrdinalIgnoreCase`
check on `Override`) but always EMITS the shipped PascalCase spelling, never invents a third
casing convention.
