"""seedsmith.adapters.items.affixfamgen.emit — validated answer -> real family JSON, matching the
shipped shape in `data/seed/items/affix-families/*.json`.

Two independent things happen here, and they are kept in two functions on purpose:

1. `assemble_entry` — turns a model ANSWER (matching `schema.affix_family_schema`) plus its
   `PartitionContext` into one entry dict, re-validating everything the schema's enums already
   constrain (defense in depth: a schema is what a WELL-FORMED answer must satisfy, not a guarantee
   that `emit.py` is only ever called with one). This is where Acceptance #3 is actually enforced,
   not merely described — `opvocab.assert_legal_op` runs on every entry, unconditionally.

2. `resolve_tier_curve` — Acceptance #1's "code resolves the tier-band curve numerics from tuning
   data", reusing `seedsmith.numerics` (the same module `seedsmith numerics rebalance` is built on)
   rather than inventing a second resolution path. **Real, honestly-reported scope limit, found
   while building this**: `seedsmith.numerics.model.OpWeight` has exactly three members (`FLAT`,
   `INCREASED`, `MORE`) and `adapters.items.channels.build_channels()` only wires the 14
   `stat.modify` primaryChannel ids to a `reference_base`. Neither covers `stat.derived`'s
   `Replace`/`Flag` ops, nor any of the 267+ derived (`combat.accuracy.{variant}`-shaped) channels —
   there is no `ProgressionModel` wiring for the "sigmoid resolver points" unit family
   `g-precision.json`'s own notes describe. So `resolve_tier_curve` succeeds for a `stat.modify`
   family on one of the 14 real primaryChannel channels, and raises `NumericsPathUnavailableError`
   (never a guess) for every `stat.derived` family — that gap belongs to `seedsmith.numerics`
   growing a derived/sigmoid resolution path, not to this module inventing one of its own, which is
   exactly what `bands.v1.json`'s own registry text and this program's "one power ladder" rule both
   forbid.
