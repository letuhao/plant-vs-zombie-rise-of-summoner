"""seedsmith.adapters.items.channels — the 14 primaryChannel families from
`data/seed/items/_registry/bands.v1.json`'s `powerBand.channelFamilyGroups.primaryChannel`,
each wired to a `reference_base` that mirrors
`src/FusionRpg.Core/Battle/BattleModels.cs`'s `BattleRuleset` formulas (transcribed with citation
below — there is no JSON export of that C# class to read instead).

The 14→3-formula grouping (which channel points at which of BattleRuleset's three baselines) is a
plain semantic read of each channel's own name, not a numeric or balance judgment: no number here
was chosen by this module, every one is copied verbatim from `BattleRuleset`. Which formula a
channel's magnitude should ultimately resolve against is real balance work and stays `numerics`'
job (S5) once `docs/architecture/power/ssot-power-scale.md`'s `ProgressionPoint` exists — this
module only proves `channels()` returns real, citable baselines rather than an empty placeholder.
