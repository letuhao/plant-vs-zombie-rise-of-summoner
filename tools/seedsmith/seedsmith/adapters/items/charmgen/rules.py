"""seedsmith.adapters.items.charmgen.rules — the charm half of the distributor.

Same shape as `setgen.distribute`, different rules. Four of them, all from `ssot-charms.md`:

| Constraint | Source |
|---|---|
| **`Flat` only** — never `Increased`, never `More` | §3.4 |
| `max_tier` at most **one band below** an equip container of the same rarity | §3.4 |
| A family may not appear on both a `jewel-minor` base type and a charm — **at all**, not at a different tier | §3.6 (the ring layer is a DECLARED family list — see `ring_layer_families`) |
| A signet: `pool_rolls = 0`, `unique_carry = 1`, and it carries a **drawback** | §3.4 |

⭐ Module 12 already turned the last row from an observation into a refusal at the DAL
(`CharmCorpus.ValidateClassRules`, reason codes `charm-signet-has-rolled-half` / `-not-unique-carry`
/ `-has-no-drawback`). This module refuses the same three at GENERATION, before the row exists —
the same rule enforced at both ends on purpose, because the runtime check cannot stop a bad row
being authored and the generator check cannot stop one being hand-edited in later.

⚠ **The axis skew is a ceiling, not a target.** The authored corpus's own axis Gini is **0.133**
(economy 20 : 10 × 4 over the 60 authored rows). *"A skew this generator must not deepen"* is that
number: a generated population may be flatter, never more concentrated. It is an inequality
ceiling, not a content ceiling — nothing here caps how many charms may exist.
