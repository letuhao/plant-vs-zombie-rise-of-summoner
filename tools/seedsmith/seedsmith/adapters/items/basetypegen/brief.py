"""seedsmith.adapters.items.basetypegen.brief — partition context + the model-facing brief.

⛔ P1, same opening line every sibling module states: **the model writes identity, code resolves
every number.** The brief hands the model exactly four choices — `name`, `flavor`, `class` (one
class-ladder rung legal for this role+frame) and `implicitFamily` (one family from this role's own
closed implicit slate), plus `tags`. It never sees `socketMax`, an `enhanceTrack` level, or a
`powerBand` NUMBER — `emit.py` resolves all three from `tuning.py`, which reads
`data/tuning/base-types-gen.v1.json` and the real registries, never a model call.

**`role`, `frame` and `band` are caller inputs, never a model choice** — the same disposition
`affixfamgen.brief`'s own docstring states for its `kindId` ("a real design choice with downstream
consequences ... this brief refuses to let the model pick it"). Here the reasons are sharper still:
spec-base-types-gen.md's own boundary is "Ask first: changing the 30-role-frame taxonomy itself",
and a per-call model-chosen role/frame would BE that change, made silently, once per call. `band`
is `naming.v1.json`'s own "symbolic class-band split ... F4 owns what 'a' vs 'b' means" — a
partition token this module reads out of the caller-supplied slot, never invents.

This is an EQUIPMENT BASE TYPE — the un-rolled chassis a rarity's affix pool later dresses. You are
naming ONE physical object a body of this frame could plausibly wear or wield in this role. Do not
invent a rarity, a level, a socket count, or a magnitude of any kind — those are resolved after you
answer, from tuning data, never from this call.

Choose, and nothing else:
1. `name` — a short, concrete display name for the object itself (e.g. "Honed Hatchet", "Cracked
   Buckler"), matching this partition's own naming register. Avoid a name already used in this
   partition (listed below).
2. `flavor` — one or two sentences of grounded, mechanical flavor for the object — never a number.
3. `class` — one of this role+frame's own legal class-ladder rungs, closed below.
4. `implicitFamily` — one of this role's own closed implicit-family slate, closed below. This is
   the ONE affix family every copy of this base type always carries — pick the one that best fits
   the object you named.
5. `tags` — one or more from the closed tag vocabulary below.

Legal `class` rungs ({len(p.class_choices)}): {', '.join(p.class_choices)}

Legal `implicitFamily` values ({len(p.implicit_families)}): {', '.join(p.implicit_families)}

Legal tags ({len(self.tag_vocab)}):
{chr(10).join('  - ' + t for t in self.tag_vocab)}

Existing names already in this partition (pick something distinct):
{_existing_names_line(p.existing_names)}

If this role+frame+band cannot carry a base type you would be happy to ship, set `blocked` and say
why."""
