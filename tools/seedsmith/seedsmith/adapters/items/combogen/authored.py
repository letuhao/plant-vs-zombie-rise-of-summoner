"""seedsmith.adapters.items.combogen.authored — plan -> graph -> assembled entry -> ledger -> file,
for one combination batch (item module 21, `combination-write-unblock`).

⛔ **What this file closes.** `run.plan_run` already assembles the whole grid deterministically
(102 subjects, real briefs, real ids); `workflow/graphs/item_combination.py` already connects one
subject's brief to an LLM caller. Nothing before this module actually DROVE a subject through that
graph and turned the result into a seed file — this is the batch driver, mirroring
`setgen.authored.run_batch`'s own shape.

⚠ **Resume/reconcile/overwrite go through `pipeline.run_ledger.RunLedger`** (module 1,
`generator-harness`), never a second ledger mechanism — the harness this module was built to wire in,
per the spec's own Project Structure line for `run.py`. `combogen.run.plan_run`'s own docstring
argues a ledger is unneeded BECAUSE re-running the whole (cheap, 102-cell) grid is byte-identical;
that argument is about `plan_run` (the deterministic PLAN), and stays true — it is not an argument
against resuming the separate, real-money WRITE step, which is exactly what every other harness-using
generator in this program (gemgen, basetypegen, materialgen, consumablegen, milestonegen) already
uses `RunLedger` for.

⚠ **Its transport is an authored-answer file, not a live endpoint** — same as `setgen.authored`
today: the graph's `call` is injected, so the identical driver runs against
`pipeline.llm_caller.call_model` the day a live transport lands (that is a SEPARATE module's own
scope, `set-charm-live-endpoint`, and this file does not anticipate it). `setgen.answers` is reused
directly rather than duplicated — nothing in `AnswerFile`/`schema_defects`/`ReplayTransport` is
set-specific; it is a generic authored-answer reader and JSON-Schema walker.
