"""seedsmith.adapters.items.combogen.grid — 12 aptitudes x 3 archetypes -> 36; C(12,2) -> 66.

⭐ **The grid is what makes 102 affordable.** 12 + 3 authored values produce 36; 12 produce 66.
Nobody authors 102 rows, and nobody transcribes twelve aptitude ids either — both axes are READ:

- the twelve from `data/seed/aptitudes/roster.json`, the checked-in mirror of
  `AptitudeCatalog.All` (whose own `Count` is `PostureCount x PerPosture`, so a thirteenth aptitude
  changes this grid by construction rather than by a forgotten edit);
- the three from `data/seed/items/_registry/build-themes.v1.json`, module 13's derived
  (aptitude, archetype) registry. Reading the archetype axis from there rather than re-declaring it
  is what keeps a Strain's grid and a build set's grid the SAME grid — `combo.strain-might-offense`
  and `build.might-offense` are the same cell, and a second literal tuple would be the place they
  drift apart.

`assert_grid_agrees()` re-measures both axes against each other on every call and RAISES on drift,
the same discipline `setgen.roles.assert_core_agrees` applies to the role table.
