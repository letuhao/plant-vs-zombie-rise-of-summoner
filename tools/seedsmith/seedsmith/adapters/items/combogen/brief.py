"""seedsmith.adapters.items.combogen.brief — aptitude semantics from the roster; ⛔ never "runeword".

**Motifs and readings inline, no citation text.** `briefkit`'s discipline: a brief carries the closed
vocabularies the model must choose from and the theme's own words, and nothing else — a citation
teaches the model to write about the document instead of the content.

Three things this brief deliberately does NOT contain, each because putting it there would break a
rule this module is built on:

- **any number** — no tier, no magnitude, no socket count, no ingredient count spelled as a digit
  the model could echo back. The schema fixes the ingredient array at exactly four items; the brief
  says "the ingredients listed below", and the count is the array's own length.
- **any element** — the twelve aptitudes do not map to the six elements and nothing here invents
  one. D22-as-amended keys the bonus on each ingredient gem's own element, which the model never
  chooses.
- **the banned word** — asserted, not intended: `build_brief` scans its own output before returning.

A combination is what a player gets for filling an item's sockets with the right set of inserts. It
is a PLAN, not a lottery: a cheap base of the right role, its sockets opened by crafting, and the
inserts collected on purpose. So it must grant a MECHANISM — a proc, a rider, a spawn, a new
behaviour — never simply more of the stat its own ingredients already carry. That is the difference
between a combination and a volume discount with a name.

Choose, and nothing else:
1. `ingredients` — the gem families whose inserts assemble this combination, from the closed list
   below. The array's length is fixed; repeats are allowed and mean "more than one of that family".
   Order does not matter and is not recorded: the recipe is matched as an unordered collection.
2. `grants` — one or two atom families this combination grants, from the second list.
3. `hostRole` / `hostFrame` — omit either to leave it open. Naming a role pins the combination to
   that chassis; only the roles listed can hold this many inserts at all.
4. `name`, `nameKey`, `flavor`.

Never choose a number, a strength, a duration or a tier. Those are resolved after you answer.

Ingredient families a live gem can actually supply ({supply.family_count} of them, from \
{supply.gem_count} shipped gems):
{_supply_lines(supply, supply_limit)}

Grantable atom families ({len(granted_families)}):
{chr(10).join('  - ' + f for f in granted_families[:granted_limit])}\
{chr(10) + '  - ...and ' + str(len(granted_families) - granted_limit) + ' more'
 if len(granted_families) > granted_limit else ''}

Legal host roles: {', '.join(host_roles)}.

If this cell cannot carry a combination you would be happy to ship, set `blocked` and say why."""
