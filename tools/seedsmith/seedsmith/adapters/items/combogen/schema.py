"""seedsmith.adapters.items.combogen.schema — closed-enum output, audit_schema-clean by construction.

⛔ P1: **the model writes identity, deterministic code writes magnitude.** The model picks the name,
the flavour, the four ingredient FAMILIES and the granted atom families. It never emits a number,
and that is enforced mechanically two ways: `test_strain_splice_gen.py`'s
`test_a_bare_integer_magnitude_field_fails_pipeline_construction` builds a real
`pipeline.model.Pipeline` around this function's output and proves `Pipeline.__post_init__` raises
at CONSTRUCTION for an injected numeric field; `test_the_schema_is_audit_schema_clean` proves the
un-tampered schema itself passes. **Note for whoever wires the live generation graph
(`workflow/graphs/item_combination.py`, `combogen/authored.py`):** neither of those two files
constructs a `Pipeline` — like `setgen.authored`/`workflow/graphs/item_set.py`, they drive the
model call through the `workflow.graphs` generation graph instead, which has no construction-time
audit hook of its own. `Pipeline` here is the mechanical PROOF this schema is clean, not the
runtime path a real batch takes; the graph path is proven clean by the SAME `audit_schema()` call,
run directly rather than through `Pipeline`.

Four names this schema avoids rather than allow-listing its way past
(`pipeline.model.MAGNITUDE_DENY_NAMES`): `tier` (the granted tier comes from tuning plus D22's
attunement bonus), `cost`, `duration` and `chance`. `minTier` never appears either — the P1 table
assigns it to code, and offering the model a per-ingredient tier is the shape most likely to be
mistaken for a magnitude the model may choose.

⚠ **`ingredients` is a flat array of four family strings, and repeats are legal.** D41 makes a
recipe an unordered MULTISET, so "two `atom.bulwark` and two `atom.vitality`" is a legal answer and
must be expressible; a schema with four distinct named slots would have re-introduced position by
the back door. `emit.ingredient_rows` folds the array into `(family, minTier, qty)` rows.
