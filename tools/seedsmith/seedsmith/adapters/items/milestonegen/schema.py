"""seedsmith.adapters.items.milestonegen.schema — closed vocabularies + the model's answer schema.

Three closed vocabularies, each transcribed from real, currently-shipped sources and cited:

- `STAT_MODIFY_OPS` — the real op vocabulary `stat.modify` atoms accept, per `AtomKindRegistry.cs`
  (see `__init__.py`'s module docstring for the full citation). `Override` is deliberately absent —
  it is the one op the real consumer refuses at bind time.
- `PRIMARY_CHANNELS` — a mirror of `FusionRpg.Core.Stats.StatChannels.All`
  (`src/FusionRpg.Core/Stats/ModifierOp.cs:69-75`), the exact 23 Unity-mapped channel strings
  `stat.modify`'s own `ParamDef("channel", ..., Vocabulary: () => PrimaryChannels)` validates
  against (`AtomKindRegistry.cs:498-499`, `AtomKindRegistry.PrimaryChannels = Stats.StatChannels.All`
  at line 83). There is no JSON export of that C# array to read programmatically — same situation
  `adapters.items.channels` already documents for `BattleRuleset`'s formulas — so this is a literal
  transcription, not a re-derivation, and `test_enhancement_milestones_gen.py` pins it against the
  literal C# source text so a future channel added there is caught by a failing test rather than a
  silent drift.
- `TAG_VOCAB` — the tag vocabulary the real shipped corpus already uses (`offensive`, `defensive`,
  `utility` — every one of the ten `enh.*` entries' own `tags` array uses exactly one of these three).

`CHANNEL_TUNING` is this generator's OWN closed subset of `PRIMARY_CHANNELS` — the channels it is
willing to offer a model for a NEW enhancement milestone, each mapped to the op and powerBand code
resolves deterministically (P1: the model picks `channel`, never `op`/`powerBand`). It is a strict
subset by design (some primary channels — `zombieSpeed`, `attackCountdown`, and the like — belong to
the zombie/board side of the ladder, not a plant-facing enhancement milestone), not the full 23.

#: values the real data itself already commits to.
POWER_BANDS: "tuple[str, ...]" = ("trivial", "low", "medium", "high")

#: This generator's own offered channel set: a strict subset of `PRIMARY_CHANNELS`, each mapped to

#: Every value pair here is drawn from `STAT_MODIFY_OPS` / `POWER_BANDS` respectively (asserted by a
#: test), so a typo here cannot mint an entry the real consumer would reject.

#: (`element`/`trigger`, no `channel`/`op` at all), out of this pass's scope.
