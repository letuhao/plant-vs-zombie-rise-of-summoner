"""seedsmith.adapters.items.consumablegen.run — the run plan, the ledger, and the reconcile report.

Two separate jobs live here, and they read two different corpora:

1. **Reconcile the real 60-entry corpus** (`load_corpus` / `reconcile_grants_and_cooldowns`) —
   acceptance criterion 2. This is a pure read: it never writes into
   `data/seed/items/consumables/*.json` (out of scope per the spec's own Boundaries — "deciding
   whether/how those 60 specific rows should grant an action is a content decision... not this
   generator's to make unprompted").
2. **Plan and persist newly generated rows** through `pipeline.run_ledger.RunLedger` — acceptance
   criterion 3 ("output through generator-harness's ledger"), with `family` checked against the real
   `atom-family-library.md` vocabulary via `pipeline.dependency_validator`'s `EXTERNAL` reference
   kind before anything is marked done.
