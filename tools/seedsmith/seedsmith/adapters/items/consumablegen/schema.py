"""seedsmith.adapters.items.consumablegen.schema — the closed vocabularies a `consumable` entry is
validated against, ported from real, code-and-doc sources (never invented here):

- `classId` / the two seam columns (`grantsActionId`, `cooldownKey`) — `kinds.py:98-101`'s real,
  ported `consumable` `KindSpec` (itself ported from `KindCatalog.cs`), narrowed to the **three**
  classes v1 may author (`restore`, `draught`, `ward`) per
  `docs/architecture/item/ssot-consumables.md` §3.1's own table — `board`/`revive`/`utility` are
  "declare only" there, each blocked on a named, unbuilt executor, and none of the 60 shipped rows
  uses one (measured below in `test_consumables_gen.py`).
- `useContext` — `ssot-consumables.md` §5.2's closed set (`menu` · `dispatch` · `battle` · `lawn`),
  narrowed to the three v1 may author. `lawn` is refused outright (§9 item 5(b)'s own current
  answer), so it is never offered to the model and never accepted from one.
- `powerBand` — `data/seed/items/_registry/bands.v1.json`'s frozen 5-rung enum, read fresh (not
  transcribed), the same discipline `registries.py` already uses for every other closed vocabulary
  it loads.
- `family` — **the one EXTERNAL reference in this module**
  (`pipeline/dependency_validator.py`'s `EXTERNAL` kind). `load_atom_family_names()` parses
  `docs/architecture/effect-atom/atom-family-library.md` §3 (the family library, not the sparse
  `data/seed/atoms/*.json` generated-instance corpus `items/registries.py:load_atom_families()`
  already owns for `unique` — a different, much smaller vocabulary answering a different question).
  This program never authors a family id itself; it only ever checks one the model proposed against
  this real, closed list. An unresolved `family` is reported as a gap for effect-atom to fix
  (dependency_validator's own EXTERNAL contract: validated like a hard reference, never backfilled).
