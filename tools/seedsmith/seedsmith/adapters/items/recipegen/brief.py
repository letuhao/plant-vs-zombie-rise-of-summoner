"""seedsmith.adapters.items.recipegen.brief — the model-facing brief, and every closed vocabulary
it draws from, read fresh from real registries/tuning/corpora rather than hand-copied.

**`(role, frame, band)` is a caller input, never a model choice, for a `forge`-operation draw** —
the same disposition `basetypegen.brief`'s own docstring states for its own partition triple: a
per-call model-chosen target partition would silently redraw the 30-role-frame taxonomy once per
call. A caller wanting a `forge` recipe names the partition; the model then either points at an
EXISTING, un-recipe'd base type in it or asks to mint a new one (`schema.MINT_NEW_SENTINEL`) —
never an arbitrary id string.

**Material ids and cost bands are the full closed vocabularies, always** — 27 issuable ids
(`materialgen.vocab.ISSUABLE`) and 5 cost bands (`bands.v1.json`, mirrored into
`data/tuning/materials.v1.json`'s own `costBandMultiplierPerMille` and read fresh from there, never
hand-typed a second time in this package — the same "read the mirror the C# class itself reads"
discipline `materialgen.vocab`'s own module docstring states).
