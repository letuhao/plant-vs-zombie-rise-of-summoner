"""seedsmith.adapters.items.recipegen.opvocab — the ONE place that knows the real, closed
`operation` vocabulary a recipe row may ever name (spec-recipes-gen.md acceptance #2 and "Code
style": *"`opvocab.py` reads the real, current operation vocabulary from its C# source of truth ...
rather than hand-typing a Python copy of it"*).

⛔ **This is the exact gap that let the 2026-09-05 drift happen unnoticed.** A human rewrote
`"operation": "reroll"` into `"reroll-one"`/`"reroll-all"` directly in the committed JSON because no
tool checked the corpus against the real vocabulary. This module is that check.

**Transcribed with citation, not hand-guessed — the same discipline `affixfamgen.opvocab` and
`materialgen.vocab` both state for their own closed vocabularies.** There is no JSON export of
`CraftOperation`/`CraftOperations` to read programmatically from Python, so the ten ids below are
copied verbatim from the real enum and its `Id()` switch, with exact line citations, and
`test_reconcile_operations_finds_zero_drift_in_the_real_30_entry_corpus_today` (in
`tests/test_recipes_gen.py`) is what catches a future drift between this transcription and the
real enum: it asserts the shipped corpus's own `operation` values are a subset of `ALL_OPERATIONS`,
so a real rename that this file is not updated for shows up as a red test, not a silent gap.

Real evidence, read directly from `src/FusionRpg.Core/Items/Materials/CostClassMatrix.cs`:

    CostClassMatrix.cs:11-44   `enum CraftOperation` — ten members, Forge=0 first, RerollAll=9 last.
                               Ordinal IS `CraftOperations.All`'s own order (`OrderBy(o => (int)o)`).
    CostClassMatrix.cs:49-62   `CraftOperations.Id(CraftOperation)` — the literal kebab-case content
                               id for each member (`RerollOne -> "reroll-one"`, `RerollAll ->
                               "reroll-all"` — the exact two strings the 2026-09-05 patch introduced).
    CostClassMatrix.cs:101-120 `CostClassMatrix.CatalystFor(CraftOperation)` — which catalyst id (if
                               any) an operation rides. `Upcycle`/`Socket` ride none (their own
                               doc comment: "neither brings anything into existence").
    CostClassMatrix.cs:123-138 `CostClassMatrix.Allows(CraftOperation, MaterialClass)` — which spend
                               classes an operation may name at all, enforced at import
                               (`MaterialRecipeCatalog.Load` calls `CostClassMatrix.Check` per cost
                               line). `Souls` (the flat fee) is legal for every operation.

**`outputKind` per operation is NOT itself part of `CraftOperation`/`CostClassMatrix` — it is a
fact about what each operation DOES, read off the real 30-entry corpus and each operation's own doc
comment on the enum** (`Forge`: "Mint a base from nothing"; `Upcycle`: "Convert ... grade g into ...
grade g+1"; everything else in the shipped corpus mutates an owned instance). `ForgeGem` mints too
(a gem, not a base-type or a material) but its own target corpus (`gemgen`) is outside this
module's reference manifest (spec's manifest table names only `base-types-gen` for `container` and
`materials-gen` for `material`) — so this module does not offer `forge-gem` for generation; it is
still a legal PARSE per `CraftOperations.TryParse` (a real recipe naming it would not be refused for
having an unrecognized operation), but `SUPPORTED_FOR_GENERATION` excludes it until a `forge-gem`
reference target is specified. Same for `Imbue`'s own doc comment ("its `op_kind` is module 15's to
add, not this module's") — legal to parse, but not offered by this generator's brief since the real
corpus never uses it and this module has no basis to invent one.
