"""seedsmith.adapters.items.recipegen.schema — the closed-enum answer schema.

⛔ P1, the same opening line every sibling module states: **the model writes identity plus the
verb/output pairing; code resolves every magnitude.** The model picks `name`, `flavor`, `operation`
(closed to `opvocab.SUPPORTED_FOR_GENERATION`), `frame`, `costLines` (material + costBand pairs,
both closed enums), an optional `soulsCostBand`, and — only for a `container`-output (`forge`)
recipe — `outputTarget` from a small, partition-scoped candidate list. It never picks `outputKind`
(derived from `operation`, see `opvocab.OPERATION_OUTPUT_KIND`), `outputQty` (always `1` — every
one of the real 30 shipped entries carries `outputQty: 1`, never authored), or a resolved quantity
for any cost line (recipes author BANDS, `bands.v1.json`'s own formula resolves them to a number at
runtime, never at authoring time — `seed-contract.md` §1/§3, restated in `MaterialRecipeCatalog.cs`'s
own class doc: "authors write bands, never magnitudes").
