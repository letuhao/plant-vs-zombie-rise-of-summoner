"""seedsmith.adapters.items.gemgen.emit — ids, icon keys, the power-band rotation, and the final
entry shape.

Mirrors `setgen/emit.py`'s own discipline: an id (or field) this module would refuse to mint raises
`IdRefused` naming the exact rule it would have broken, rather than silently producing something
`ContainerValidator.cs` (or `ItemSeedValidator`) would reject later. The contract this module targets
is `docs/architecture/item/entry-shapes.md` §1's own gem shape:

    {
      "id": "gem.g2-014",
      "nameKey": "gem.ember-shard",
      "name": "Ember Shard",
      "family": "atom.elemental-power",
      "element": "fire",
      "powerBand": "medium",
      "affinityElement": "fire",
      "iconKey": "icon.gem.ember-shard",
      "tags": ["offensive"]
    }

`element`/`affinityElement` are omitted for a family with no element variant (§1's own rule) —
`assemble_entry` follows the same omission, never writing a `null`.

#: balance need asks for the other two rungs — widening this rotation is a one-line, reviewed change,
#: not a silent guess at what an unused rung should mean here.
#:
#: A fixed round robin, not a per-family judgement call, because gem partitioning itself has "no
#: thematic or mechanical meaning" (entry-shapes.md §1's own finding) — the same is true of which
#: rung a given batch position lands on.
