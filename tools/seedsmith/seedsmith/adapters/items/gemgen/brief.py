"""seedsmith.adapters.items.gemgen.brief — an unauthored affix family -> a brief.

Mirrors `setgen/brief.py`'s own discipline (no magnitude, no invented vocabulary, closed picks
inlined) but the shape is simpler: a gem does not carry a theme, a role list, or a threshold ladder —
it is one fixed container that grants ONE already-shipped effect family. So the only things this
brief ever asks a model to choose are the two genuinely creative fields, `name`/`nameKey`, plus,
only when the family has a per-element variant, which element this particular pick expresses.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT ask the model, and why:

- **`tags`** — a straight copy of the family's OWN authored, VALIDATED `tags` (read fresh from
  `data/seed/items/affix-families/*.json`). Asking the model to re-derive them risks a value that
  disagrees with the family's own combat-posture axis; the family already settled that question.
- **`powerBand`** — `emit.resolve_power_band`'s deterministic rotation. `entry-shapes.md` §1's own
  finding — "a gem's id slot number is load-bearing only for collision-safety, never for content" —
  applies exactly as well to which power-band rung a given batch position lands on.

**Which family a given subject gets is also decided by CODE, not the model** — see
`unauthored_families` below. A model choosing its own family from a big list is exactly the kind of
extra, uncontrolled degree of freedom `setgen`'s exemplar-dedup work already found expensive to
audit after the fact; here it is simply not offered.
