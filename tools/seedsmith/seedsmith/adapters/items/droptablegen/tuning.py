"""seedsmith.adapters.items.droptablegen.tuning — every closed vocabulary and real-corpus reader a
drop-table generation run needs, read fresh from disk. Nothing here is transcribed by hand from
memory or from the spec's own worked examples: every function reads the real, current shipped
content, the same "registry facts are read, never copied" discipline every sibling module states.

**The four reference kinds this module resolves against, confirmed by reading the real corpus
directly (not by reasoning — spec-drop-tables-gen.md's own correction note), plus one more found
while building this module (see `MATERIAL_QTY_CURVE_ID` below):**

| Field | Kind | Real target | Resolved by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `role`+`frame` | categorical | `base-types-gen`'s corpus | `legal_role_frame_pairs()` |
| `.ref` (material rows) | hard | `materials-gen`'s corpus, on **`runtimeId`**, never `id` | `load_material_runtime_ids()` |
| `.ref` (consumable rows) | hard | `consumables-gen`'s corpus, on `id` | `load_consumable_ids()` |
| `.ref` (gem/insert rows) | hard | `sockets-gen`'s corpus, on `id` | `load_gem_ids()` |

**Real finding (2026-09-07): a material `.ref` resolves against `materials.json`'s `runtimeId`
field, never its `id`.** `materials.json` entries carry both — `id: "material.004"` (the file's own
PK) and `runtimeId: "essence.earth"` (what every drop-table row, recipe, and curve template
actually names). The reference manifest's own worked example (`d1.json:58`: `"ref":
"essence.earth"`) already showed this, but a first pass resolving `.ref` against `id` would silently
report every real material row as unresolved — confirmed by trying it against the live corpus."""

#: the spec's own "or a d5.json continuation" phrasing reads as open-ended, but naming.v1.json's

#: entry-shapes.md §9's own worked example authors `qtyCurve: "curve.qty-material-standard"`, but
#: curves.json's own `idVsNameKeyNote` (real finding) says that DESCRIPTIVE string predates the
#: numeric id template and is not a literal id any curve entry carries -- the real numeric id is
#: `curve.019` (`nameKey: "curve.qty-material-standard"`). Confirmed against the real corpus: every
#: one of the 49 `qtyCurve` values across d1..d4 is this exact id, with no second value ever used.
#: This module reuses it verbatim rather than asking the model to choose a curve id -- there is
#: only ever one legal choice for a stacking material's yield curve today, and inventing a second
#: would be authoring a numeric resolution table, which seed-contract.md §1 reserves for the curve
#: registry, never a per-table seed.

#: `souls` is the only currency id any of the 468 shipped rows ever name (23/23, confirmed by
#: reading every drop-table currency row). Structural, not a magic number: there is exactly one
#: currency in this game, so there is no vocabulary to close here -- a second currency id would be
#: a new game system, not a balance-pass tweak to this generator.
