"""seedsmith.adapters.items.materialgen.emit — ids, and the entry shape `kinds.py`'s `material`
KindSpec declares.

⛔ **`nameKey`/`iconKey` are derived, never authored.** Every one of the 21 shipped entries in
`data/seed/items/materials/materials.json` follows the exact same mechanical pattern:

    runtimeId "essence.fire"            -> nameKey "material.essence-fire"    -> iconKey "icon.material.essence-fire"
    runtimeId "substrate.humanoid.sound" -> nameKey "material.substrate-humanoid-sound" -> iconKey "icon.material.substrate-humanoid-sound"

(dots in the runtime id become dashes, prefixed with `material.`; the icon key is `icon.` + that).
Zero of the 21 shipped rows deviate. Asking the model to also choose these — as opposed to `name`/
`flavor`, which have no mechanical derivation — is exactly the trap `setgen.schema`'s `apCost`
precedent names: two authors of the same fact eventually disagree with each other. `schema.py`
accordingly never asks for them; this module derives both from the id alone.

The corpus-level `id` (`material.NNN`, sequential across the whole corpus, not per-class) is minted
here too, from the highest existing sequence number — never from a count, which double-books the
moment a hand edit removes a row from the middle of the file.
