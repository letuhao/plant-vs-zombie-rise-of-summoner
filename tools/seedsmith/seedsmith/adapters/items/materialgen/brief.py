"""seedsmith.adapters.items.materialgen.brief — one material id -> a brief.

Motifs inline, no citation text, same discipline `setgen.brief` states directly: a brief carries the
closed vocabulary the model must choose from and the id's own mechanical facts, and nothing else.
The model is never shown a material id outside `vocab.ISSUABLE` — `build_material_brief` requires a
`vocab.MaterialId`, which only `vocab.require_issuable` ever hands out, so an unauthorized id cannot
reach this function at all, the same way `setgen.brief` never shows the model a role outside the
twelve.

Choose, and nothing else:
1. `name` — a short, evocative item name (not a restatement of the runtime id).
2. `flavor` — one to two sentences of flavor text. No numbers, no game-mechanical claims (no
   percentages, no stat names) — this is DISPLAY text, not a tooltip. The mechanics are already
   fixed by the id itself and are never yours to describe or invent.
3. `tags` — zero to four tags from the closed list below. At most one tag per axis shown
   (mass-class / material-nature / durability-class / origin) — the list is already grouped by axis
   so a legal combination is visible at a glance.

Never invent a tag outside this list, and never choose a number, a tier, or a magnitude of any
kind. Those are not yours to set.

Closed tag pool ({total_tags} ids, grouped by axis — at most one per axis):
{chr(10).join(f'  {axis}: ' + ', '.join(ids) for axis, ids in axes.items())}

If this id cannot carry content you would be happy to ship, set `blocked` and say why."""
