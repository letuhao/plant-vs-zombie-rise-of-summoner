"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.brief — theme + aptitude + archetype → a brief.

**Motifs inline, no citation text.** `briefkit`'s own discipline: a brief carries the closed
vocabularies the model must choose from and the theme's own words, and nothing else — a citation
teaches the model to write about the document instead of the content.

Two things this brief deliberately does NOT contain, each because putting it there would break P1:

- **any number** — no tier, no magnitude, no per-mille, no AE budget. The model is not being asked
  to respect a budget; the distributor enforces it afterwards. Telling the model the budget invites
  it to reason numerically, which is the exact habit `audit_schema` exists to prevent.
- **any role outside the twelve** — the cap is applied here, in the brief, by construction. The
  model is never shown `head-guard`, so `SetRoleNotUniversal` is unproducible from a well-formed
  answer (ssot-sets §3.7 fires at LOAD; ~1,000 sets checked after the fact is a re-run).

   order. The lowest ({ladder[0]}) takes no families — it carries the capability. {_higher_sentence(higher)}

Motifs to express: {', '.join(theme.motifs)}.{anti}{lore}
How this theme expresses itself in an item: {theme.expression_item}

A charm is carried by the commander, not worn by one actor: it is always on, it applies to every
deployed actor, and it buys that breadth with depth. So it carries FLAT effects only — never a
percentage, never a multiplier.

Choose, and nothing else:
1. `charmClass` — one of: {classes}. Use the assigned class when one is provided. A signet is named,
   carries a drawback, and rolls nothing.{class_instruction}
2. `axis` — one of offense, survivability, control, utility, economy. Pick the assigned axis when
   one is provided; otherwise pick the one this species actually leans into.{axis_instruction}
3. `frameHint`, `families` (one or two always-on families from the list below), `name`, `flavor`.
   A signet also names its `drawback` family.
   `name` must be a new, specific surface name for this species; do not reuse a generic name
   such as a familiar weapon/material phrase or any name you have seen in another item.

Never choose a number, a cost, a strength or a tier. Those are resolved after you answer.
(There is no `nameKey` field to fill in — it is derived automatically from `name`.)

The list below is the WHOLE legal pool — every id in it is accepted, and nothing outside it is.
Copy an id exactly as printed, including the element suffix where one is shown.
Do not prepend `atom.` to an id that already starts with `atom.` (for example, write
`atom.death-salvo`, never `atom.atom.death-salvo`).

Always-on families ({len(pool)} picks):
{_charm_pick_lines(pool)}

Decision rule for difficult motifs: do not block merely because the motif suggests a projectile,
trigger, multiplier, or narrative mechanic. Choose the closest legal always-on FLAT family and
let the deterministic planner enforce its magnitude and tier rules. Set `blocked` only when no
legal family/class/axis combination exists in the printed pool, or when the theme's anti-motifs
forbid every such combination. Explain that concrete incompatibility in `blocked`."""
