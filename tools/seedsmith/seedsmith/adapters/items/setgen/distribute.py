"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.distribute — the deterministic half of P1.

The model has chosen identity. This module prices it: capability at the lowest threshold, stats
above, a magnitude for every one of them through `numerics`, a roll plan for every member piece, and
a refusal for every constraint the choice broke. **It emits no number of its own** — every magnitude
is a `numerics.resolve` result, and the AE budget is compared in integer per-mille.

The constraint table, and where each row comes from:

| Constraint | Source |
|---|---|
| Exactly **one** capability atom, at the **lowest** threshold | ssot-sets §3.2 |
| Every higher threshold: `stat.modify` / `stat.derived` only | §3.2 |
| **No `More`-op modifier on any set tier** | §3.5 rule 2 |
| A threshold at **2**; top threshold ≤ member count | §3.4 |
| At most 6 roles, all inside the twelve | §3.4, §3.7 |
| At most one armament role | §3.5 rule 4 (`SetRoleForbidden`) |
| Total set value ≤ 1.5 AE per member piece | §3.5 rule 3 |
| 2 fixed atoms + 2 rolls over a 2-tier window per piece | §3.9 |
