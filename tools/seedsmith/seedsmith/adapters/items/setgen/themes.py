"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.themes — the theme bridge, one-way.

⛔ **Demons publish; items consume; nothing here writes a demon** (`spec-demon-themes.md` §2.2). This
module opens `data/seed/demons/_registry/themes.v1.json` for reading and opens nothing under
`data/seed/demons/` for writing — `nothing_in_the_generator_writes_the_demons_corpus` asserts that
structurally rather than by promise.

Three populations of `themeKey`, collision-free by prefix:

| prefix | population | source |
|---|---|---|
| `theme.` | 13 legacy, 5 in use | `data/seed/items/_registry/themes.v1.json` (frozen) |
| `demon.` | one per species | `data/seed/demons/_registry/themes.v1.json` (published) |
| `build.` | 36, aptitude x archetype | `data/seed/items/_registry/build-themes.v1.json` (new, D-ruled 2026-09-04) |

⚠ **D34's enrichment precondition remains visible here.** `theme-refresh` now reads the complete
almanac dump and appends themes for the full shipped roster. Themes whose source remains
`basis = "name"` are *held*, never generated from — `generatable` excludes them and
`holdback_report` names the count, so an incomplete run reports `not_measured` instead of a green
partial. Coverage counts are always derived by `coverage_report`; never transcribe a roster size.

⚠ **Nothing here may key on a theme's `rarity`** (§2.4a): `RarityForRank` is proportional in `count`,
so a species moves tier as the roster grows *without moving rank*. A theme records the rarity it was
published against precisely so a later reader sees the drift instead of inheriting it. `rarity` is
carried through to provenance and read by nothing else.
