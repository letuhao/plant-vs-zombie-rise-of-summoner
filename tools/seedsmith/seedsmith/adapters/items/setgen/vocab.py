"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.vocab — the capability and stat pick vocabularies, COUNTED.

⛔ The standing rule this program produced at plan time applies here harder than anywhere else:
**never derive a design proportion from a snapshot of a generated corpus — count it, or don't quote
it.** The capability vocabulary is the ceiling on how many genuinely different sets can exist
(ssot-sets §3.2 puts exactly one capability atom on every set, at its lowest threshold), so a
transcribed "60" that has drifted is a design conclusion drawn from a stale number.

Counted fresh from `data/seed/items/affix-families/*.json` on every call. Measured 2026-09-04:

    98 families = 42 capability + 56 stat
    capability picks : 39 element-free  +  3 x 7 variant                        =  60
    stat picks       :  2 element-free  + 31 x 7 variant  + 23 stat.modify      = 242

A family whose `variants` block says `{"generate": "elements+omni"}` expands into one pick per
element plus omni — the params are otherwise FIXED per family (`atom.venomous` is always `poison`),
so a family without that block is exactly one pick.
