"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.emit — ids, and the one that would have shipped broken.

⛔ **A demon `themeKey` cannot go into a set id.** `naming.v1.json` (registryVersion 4, frozen) gives
sets `idTemplate: "set.{themeId}-{seq:03}"`. A demon theme key is `demon.allpeater`; substituting it
yields `set.demon.allpeater-001` — **two dots**, which fails `definitions.md` §1's grammar (the body
after the first dot is `[a-z0-9-]+`, no dot; `ContainerValidator.cs` mirrors it). Composed with
ssot-sets §4.3's tier suffix it is worse.

> **The id uses the theme's `speciesId`, never its `themeKey`.** `set.allpeater-001`, tier
> `set.allpeater-001-04`.

⚠ The zero pad on the tier suffix is load-bearing, not cosmetic — module 12 proved it at the DAL:
the actor effect list orders by `container_id ASC`, so `-02`, `-04`, `-10` sort correctly only
because they are padded. Its `ThresholdContainerIds` refuses a `set_id` ending in `-NN` for the same
reason, and this module refuses to MINT one.
