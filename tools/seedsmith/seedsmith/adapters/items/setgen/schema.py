"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.schema — the closed-enum output schema, audit_schema-clean by
construction.

⛔ P1, unamended: **the model writes identity, deterministic code writes magnitude.** The model picks
which capability, which stat families, which member roles, the name and the flavour. It never emits a
number — and that is enforced mechanically, by `pipeline.model.audit_schema`, which
`Pipeline.__post_init__` runs at CONSTRUCTION. A numeric field cannot reach a model call at all.

⚠ `pieces` is the one place a number is legal, and only as a closed enum. Written as a bare
`{"type": "integer"}` the schema is rejected before the first call. Said in the schema, not in a
comment — which is why `threshold_pieces` reads its enum from `distribute.threshold_ladder` rather
than repeating it: which piece counts a set may carry is one fact, and a second copy here is where
it goes stale. It did: the enum offered `{2,3,4,6}` while the ladder derived `(2,4)`, and the first
real batch lost all three sets to it.

⚠ Two field names the deny-list would refuse, and how this schema avoids them rather than
allow-listing its way past them: `tier` (a magnitude by convention) never appears — tiers come from
`numerics`; and `cost` never appears — a charm's AP cost is DERIVED from its class.

    `trees/nodegen`'s own 2026-09-06 finding (`_derive_unique_name_key`'s docstring) found the
    model repeatedly falls back to a generic templated key decoupled from its own `name` choice;
    this program's own incident, the same day `maxLength` was added below as a mitigation, found a
    WORSE failure mode on the identical field — a quantized model (reproduced on two different
    models) degenerating into a repeated-token loop that burned the full `max_tokens` budget on
    garbage, with the `maxLength`/`pattern` constraints both silently unenforced by LM Studio's
    grammar sampler. `nameKey` is pure mechanical derivation from `name` (`set.<slug-of-name>` /
    `charm.<slug-of-name>`, `seedfile.py`'s own `_derive_unique_name_key`) — there is no
    information in it the model could add, and no validation value in asking for it that

    `additionalProperties: false` on every schema that embeds this, the model cannot legally emit
    a `nameKey` key at all, not merely "is discouraged from" one.

    `members[].role` is the twelve-role cap **inside the schema**, not a validation afterthought:
    the model is never offered `head-guard`, so `SetRoleNotUniversal` cannot be produced by a
    well-formed response at all. That is the whole reason the cap is a generator input
    (ssot-sets §3.7 fires at LOAD, so ~1,000 sets checked after the fact is a re-run).

    ⭐ **`thresholds` is sized from the ladder for the same reason.** `member_count` defaults to the
    typical size, which is what `run.plan_run` briefs; the ladder it produces fixes both the legal
    `pieces` values and how many threshold rows there are. Before this, `minItems` was a flat 2 and
    a five-member set (ladder `(2,)`) could not satisfy the schema at all — nor could a two-member
    one, at the other end.

    ⛔ Real incident, 2026-09-08: `"required": []` (every field optional-by-omission) was the
    ORIGINAL design, needed so a `blocked` answer legally carries none of the content fields.
    A live 53-subject run — AFTER the brief-truncation and `resolve_capability` fixes closed two
    other real defects — still escalated on the SAME remaining defect on every subject: the model
    never emitted `name`/`flavor` at all, not even after 3 self-heal rounds that named the exact
    missing keys. Direct isolation (calling the model once, outside the retry loop, with the
    identical brief) proved it: LM Studio's grammar-from-JSON-Schema sampler, given `"required":
    []`, treats every optional trailing free-text field as safely omittable and the model never
    generates them — re-prompting with the field names does not help, because nothing at the
    GRAMMAR level ever offers the tokens for those keys once the sampler has decided to skip them.
    Making every property `required` and expressing "optional" via `"type": [X, "null"]` instead
    (the actual OpenAI Structured Outputs `strict: true` contract this schema already opts into
    via `call_model`'s own `response_format`, and was never actually honoring) fixed it: the SAME
    live model, same brief, immediately started filling `name`/`flavor` with real content once the
    schema asked for them this way. `answers.schema_defects` and `answer_declares_content` were
    both updated the same day to treat an absent key and an explicit `null` identically, so this
    is purely a wire-format concession to the constrained-decoding sampler, not a new semantic
    requirement on hand-authored/replayed answers.
