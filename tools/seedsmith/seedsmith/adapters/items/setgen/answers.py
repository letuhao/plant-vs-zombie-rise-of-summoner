"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.answers — the authored-answer transport, and the schema check
a replayed answer does not get for free.

⛔ **Why this exists at all.** Module 13 built everything a generation run needs except the step
that turns a brief into an answer, and recorded that gap as *"the generation graph is not wired,
and `--write` says so instead of writing nothing."* The graph's `generate` node takes an injected
`call` (`make_generate_node(..., call=...)`) precisely so the transport is replaceable — the same
seam `demon_anchor.py` and `effect_affix.py` already rely on for their tests. This module supplies
the transport that reads answers a model already authored, from a file, instead of opening a
socket. It imports nothing from `pipeline.llm_caller`, so a run driven by it **cannot** reach the
network, and a test asserts that by module text.

⚠ **Constrained decoding is what a live call gets and a replayed one does not.** `Pipeline`'s
`audit_schema` proves the SCHEMA is clean; a real endpoint additionally refuses to sample a
response that violates it. An authored answer arrives as plain JSON with no such guarantee, so the
schema has to be enforced here, on the way in. `schema_defects` is that enforcement — it is
deliberately a small walker over exactly the keywords these two schemas use
(`type`/`enum`/`required`/`additionalProperties`/`minItems`/`maxItems`/`minLength`/`maxLength`/
`pattern`) rather than a dependency: `jsonschema` is not in `pyproject.toml`'s pins, and adding a
runtime dependency to close a fifty-line gap is the wrong trade for a program whose central claim
is byte-identical reproducibility.

⭐ **A subject may carry MORE THAN ONE authored attempt, and that is not a convenience.** The graph
routes `validate -> generate` with the named defects appended when a draft is rejected, so a repair
pass is a real edge in the shipped design. A transport that could only answer once would make that
edge unreachable and quietly turn every rejection into an escalation. Attempts are consumed in
order; running out is `AnswerExhausted`, which is an honest escalation rather than a silent replay
of the answer that was already refused.
