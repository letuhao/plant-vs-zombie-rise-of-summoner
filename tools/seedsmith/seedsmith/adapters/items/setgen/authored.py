"""seedsmith.adapters.items.setgen.authored — plan -> graph -> priced row -> file, for one batch.

⛔ **What this closes.** Module 13 built the plan, the schema, the distributors, the id minting, the
dedup, the cell metric, the verdict and the ledger, and then recorded one gap: *"the generation graph
is not wired, and `--write` says so instead of writing nothing."* `workflow/graphs/item_set.py` is
that graph; this module is the batch driver that feeds it planned subjects and takes priced rows out
the other end. Nothing here re-implements a rule — every refusal in the report is a string one of
module 13's own functions returned.

⚠ **Its transport is an AUTHORED ANSWER FILE, not an endpoint.** The graph's `call` is injected, so
the same driver runs against `pipeline.llm_caller.call_model` the day a live run happens. What is
built here is the path that works today: the briefs are emitted, a model answers them, and the
answers come back through `answers.replay_caller`. A batch driven this way makes **zero** network
calls and a test asserts it by handing in a raising stub.

⚠ **Every metric in this report is measured over THIS BATCH, not over the corpus.** At batch sizes
below a few hundred the distinctness thresholds are granularity-bound — module 13 already recorded
that a 5‰ near-duplicate rate is unmeasurable at n = 100 — so the report carries the population it
measured beside every number, and `verdict` still refuses to call a held run a pass.
