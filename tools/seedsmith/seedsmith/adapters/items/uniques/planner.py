"""The uniques planner (D4.29, spec-unique-pipeline.md "Metrics" section) -- model-free, runs
first. Builds the `frame x axis x band` grid (2 x 5 x 3 = 30 cells) and mints ids per cell.

**Not imported from `adapters.dungeon.planner`**, despite that module's `Cell`/`IdMinter` being
structurally identical in shape. Cross-adapter imports are not this codebase's convention --
`adapters/items/combogen/grid.py` and `adapters/items/setgen/` each already keep their OWN local
Cell/grid rather than sharing one, even within `items/` itself, and `dungeon/planner.py`'s own
`enumerate_cells` is capped at 2 dimensions ("every dungeon corpus is <=2-D") where this grid
needs 3. Duplicating the small, stable shape here matches precedent; importing across adapters
would not.

**Id grammar, and why it differs from the existing 144-corpus's poetic slugs.** The shipped
corpus's ids read `unique.<theme>-<band>-<nnn>` where `<theme>` is a hand-picked flavour slug
(`charnel-bloom`, `windswept-spore`, ...) chosen before any model call, exactly like a PLANNED
field must be (kinds.py's own `UNIQUE_OWNERSHIP["id"] == "PLANNED"`: "the planner fixes it... the
model may not change it"). A planner has no business inventing NEW flavour slugs -- picking a
name is real content judgement, the job `briefs.py` hands to the model's `name`/`flavor` output,
never to deterministic id-minting code. So this planner mints from the grid's own dimensions
instead: `unique.<frame>-<axis>-<band>-<nnn>`, e.g. `unique.plant-offense-firstseed-001` --
deterministic, unambiguous, and openly a grid id rather than a borrowed flavour slug.
