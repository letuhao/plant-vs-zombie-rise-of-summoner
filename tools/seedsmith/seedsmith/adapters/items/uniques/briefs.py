    a small fixture instead, so a schema test never depends on the live corpus's exact size).

    `role` overrides `role_for_cell(cell)`'s own default grid assignment -- needed because that
    default assumes a fresh, unoccupied (role, axis) space, and a REAL run measured 2026-09-06 that
    no such space exists for rung 80/100 at all: `naming.v1.json idNamespaces.uniques.bandAssignment`
    has rows only for ordinals 30/50/70/90, so a freshly-invented id prefix fails `IdOutsideNamespace`
    on every entry, and ordinal 90 (the nearest real row) is separately saturated on every (role,
    axis) pair. Shipping under a REAL registered ordinal (70, whose own real content already mixes
    heirloom(70) and firstseed(80) rarities under one prefix -- confirmed from the real corpus, not

    `tags: string[]` field with a "one per exclusive axis" rule stated only in prose -- the
    overwhelming majority of failures were the model omitting a mass-class tag entirely or
    picking two from the same axis, which JSON Schema's `enum` cannot forbid inside one array
    (each individual string is legal; the CROSS-CUTTING one-per-axis rule is not expressible as a
    per-item constraint). Splitting the exclusive axes into their own fields makes the violation
    structurally unreachable: each field takes exactly one value from its own closed enum under
    constrained decoding, and `assemble_tags` (this module) combines them into the real `tags[]`
    array afterward -- code does the assembly, the model only ever answers one-of-N questions."""
