"""seedsmith.adapters.effects.affix — `affix-authoring`'s own domain knowledge
(spec-affix-authoring.md, effect-pipeline module 9). The model authors a NAMED, multi-atom bundle
— *"Master of Fire and Ice"* — by picking a name and which EXISTING atoms it bundles from the
shared atom library; every number (weight, tier, magnitude) is a table's job, never the model's
(P1, restated for this content type).

Two fields are 3-way voted, same machinery `demon-seed`'s `classify-pipelines` already proved
(Q25 precedent): the affix's own **name/identity** and its **ref bundle composition** — the two
judgement calls with the highest cost of being wrong.

#: No magnitude field anywhere — `name` and `refs` only. `refs` names EXISTING atom ids from the

#: `blocked` (below) was added 2026-09-04 by `validate-heal` (A-S4, spec-validate-heal.md SS6
#: hazard 1): the shipped schema had `additionalProperties: false` and no `blocked` property, so
#: this pipeline's own model had NO WAY to decline — a live defect, not paperwork — and the schema
#: failed `pipeline.model.audit_schema`'s own "every schema needs a blocked variant" rule the
#: moment that rule was applied to it. Scope held tight per the spec: this property and its
#: description only, nothing else about the pipeline changed. `required`/`additionalProperties`
#: are untouched, so `name`/`refs` are still required even when `blocked` is true — a real,
#: separate functional gap this fix does not close (named follow-up: `affix-schema-blocked`,
#: SS6 hazard 1's own fallback if `python -m pytest tools/seedsmith/tests` had gone red, which it
#: did not).
