"""Real-run entrypoint for `affix-authoring` (T7.1/T7.2, spec-affix-authoring.md, effect-pipeline
module 9). Committed so the run is reproducible, matching `generate_commander_effects.py`'s own
precedent.

⛔ **The eligible-atom pool, made concrete rather than left unspecified.** Neither this module's own
spec nor any earlier task named where a run's own `eligibleAtoms` should come from — recorded as a
genuine open question in `tasks/seed-to-concrete-todo.md` (T7.1's own evidence block). Resolved here
the same way `commander_effect`'s own subjects come from a committed tree: the pool is every atom id
the REAL shipped seed tree (`data/seed/atoms/**.json`) actually carries — not invented, not narrowed
by a guess at which atoms "should" be biddable, the whole shared library the model may pick from.
`--only` narrows it to a themed subset for a smaller, more controllable run.

⛔ **T7.2 (2026-09-05): every draw is now a real 3-way vote, not a single unpermuted call.**
`spec-affix-authoring.md`'s own "Voted fields" section requires the affix's **name/identity** and
its **ref bundle composition** to be 3-way voted, "same machinery, same `resolve_vote` semantics" as
`creature-seed`'s own `classify-pipelines` (Q25 precedent) — but until this pass, `generate_affixes.py`
made exactly one model call per draw, so there was never a second or third sample to vote over.
`run_voted_draws` below is now that caller: THREE permuted samples per draw (`permute.order_for`,
seeded with `sample_index` INSIDE the seed per spec-option-permutation.md §3 — three votes over three
identical option orders is one sample with extra steps), `name` voted scalar via `vote.resolve_vote`.
`resolve_vote`/`order_for` are reused verbatim (per spec's own "Ask first: forking any piece of the
reused machinery" boundary); no new permutation-seeding logic is added here.

⛔ **Fixed 2026-09-06 (see [[affix-authoring-vote-bug]]): `refs` votes per-MEMBER
(`vote.resolve_set_vote`), never as one flattened whole-bundle string through `resolve_vote`.** The
original pass used `resolve_vote(canonical_bundle_key(refs))` — scalar equality over the WHOLE sorted
bundle — which a real run against the live model measured at ~90% `vote_unresolved` (9/10 and 9/10
across two real 10-draw batches), the exact SMOKE BATCH failure mode already found and fixed for
`creature-seed`'s own family/signature proposals: exact agreement across an entire 2+-member set, sampled
three times independently, is combinatorially rare even when every member was individually
well-agreed. `resolve_set_vote` credits a member into the resolved bundle once 2 of 3 samples chose
it, discarding nothing at the aggregation level that per-member evidence already settled. A resolved
bundle can still land below the schema's `minItems: 2` (a real, distinct, newly-handled case — see
`bundle_too_small_after_vote` below), which whole-bundle voting could never produce (its winning value
was always a real 2+-member sample to begin with).

Usage:
    python -m seedsmith.adapters.effects.affix.generate_affixes --dry-run   # briefs only
    python -m seedsmith.adapters.effects.affix.generate_affixes --count 5   # real model calls
    python -m seedsmith.adapters.effects.affix.generate_affixes --species-id Alpha --count 8

⛔ **`--species-id` (task J7, spec-species-tree.md §5.2/§5.3 rule 3), added 2026-09-07.** Investigated
against the real code before writing anything: as shipped, this tool could not target
`affix.species.<speciesId>.*` at all — `ID_PREFIX`/`OUTPUT_DIR` were bare module constants, not
parameters, and `data/seed/passive-tree/species/<speciesId>.json` (spec's own Project structure
table) is silent on where a species' OWN affix corpus should live. **Decision made and stated here,
not left unresolved**: one file per species, `data/seed/effects/affixes/species/<speciesId>.json`,
mirroring the identical per-species-file convention that table already uses for the tree's own
seed/plan/concrete stages — never one shared 6,720-entry file, and never per-node files (too
granular, nothing needs that resolution). `--species-id` derives `id_prefix`, `output_dir` and
`filename` from ONE flag so a caller cannot typo a prefix that drifts from `SpeciesUniquenessMetric`'s
own `affix.species.<speciesId>.*` pattern (`metrics/passive_tree.py`, task J6); every underlying
function still accepts the raw `id_prefix`/`output_dir`/`filename` parameters directly; for tests.
Every parameter below defaults to EXACTLY its old hardcoded value, so every pre-existing call site
(`run_t71_claude_propose.py`, both test files, the plain `--count N` CLI form) is unaffected byte for
byte. `next_draw_start_index` itself needed no change: draw numbering restarts at 0 inside a fresh
per-species file, which is collision-free by construction since the SPECIES id is already embedded in
the full affix id (`affix.species.Alpha.affix-draw-000` vs `affix.species.Beta.affix-draw-000` are
different ids even though `affix-draw-000` repeats). **The 6,720-affix production run itself is
deliberately NOT launched by this change** — it remains its own scheduled decision (spec's own
"largest unbudgeted item in the program" framing), now unblocked rather than attempted blind.

    (`spec-affix-schema.md` §"What is genuinely new here": `slot E1 : domain = element, pick = 1`,
    ref `atom.elemental-power.$E1`) is a parameterised atom reference: it names a DOMAIN and lets one
    choice be shared across several refs. The catalog's own unique key is already
    `(family_id, tier, variant)`, so the families a slot could vary over are exactly those carrying
    **more than one variant** — the same "read what the shipped data already says" move
    `AffixTags.Of` makes when it derives an affix's tags from its refs instead of having them
    authored.

    **`domain` is the honest half.** A multi-variant family is only *groundable* for a model when its
    variant axis matches a real, named domain with real members. Today that is `element` and nothing
    else. A family whose variants are opaque discriminators (`a`/`b`/`c`) is structurally
    slot-shaped but semantically empty: asking a model to pick a domain for it would be asking it to
    invent a vocabulary, which is precisely the "plausible-looking guess" P1 forbids — the same
    reason `data/seed/items/affix-families/g-armour.json`'s own authoring notes give for refusing to
    invent a `variants.generate` vocabulary for channel-pairs.

    **Expected to be empty of groundable rows today, and that is the correct answer, not a bug.**
    Nothing in the shipped tree uses an element-variant axis yet, so this returns the structurally
    eligible families with `domain: None`. It lights up on its own the day E30's element pools ship
    a family whose variants are real element ids — no code change needed, which is the whole point

      * `unresolved` — keyed by draw id, the reason a draw produced no entry: a 1-1-1 split on `name`
        or zero ref members reaching a majority (`"vote_unresolved"`); a resolved ref vote landing
        below the schema's 2-member minimum (`"bundle_too_small_after_vote"`); or fewer than
        `SAMPLES_PER_DRAW` samples ever validated (`"insufficient_valid_samples"`) — a dead sample is
        not a silent drop, it shows up here.
      * `results` — the per-sample-state graph outcome, keyed by the sample's own subject id, for a
        caller's own `byOutcome` accounting (unchanged shape from before this pass).

    `call` is injected (never imported directly) so a test proves the exact number of model calls
