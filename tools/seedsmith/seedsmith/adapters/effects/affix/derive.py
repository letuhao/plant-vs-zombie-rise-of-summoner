(spec-affix-authoring.md, seed-contract.md §2.1). Mirrors `AffixValidator.AffixClassOfAtom` and its
own bundle-aggregation rule in `src/FusionRpg.Core/Effects/Atoms/AffixValidator.cs` exactly: an atom
with no `when.trigger` is a permanent modifier and derives "prefix"; one that declares a trigger
derives "suffix"; a bundle spanning both derives "mixed" (A1 — it consumes one of each roll budget).

`affix_class` is DERIVED, never authored — P1's own boundary, restated for this content type: a
model that names its own class can contradict the bundle it just picked.
