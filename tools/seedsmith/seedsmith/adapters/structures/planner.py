"""base-defense `structure-planner` (module 27, spec-structure-planner.md). **Decide what to
generate before anything is generated — deterministically, with no model** (owner decision 33).

Five things fixed here, all model-free (spec §2), plus a sixth this module's own reading of
`structure-instantiate`'s (26) real container-shape resolution adds — see `CONTAINER_POLICY`'s own
docstring for why a sixth was missing from the spec's own text and belongs here, not left silently
undeclared:

1. The tier ladder, ordered.
2. Which roles exist and the target count per role.
3. Which (role × slot kind) combinations are legal.
4. How many variants per row.
5. Which `acquisitionPaths` each kind may declare.
6. Container policy — whether a row may name a `ContainerId`, and who assigns it.

Zero model calls. `build_plan()` is a pure function of `(corpus rows, tuning, seed)` — no
`datetime`, no unseeded `random`. `seed` is accepted for interface stability (a future planner
decision might need seeded tie-breaking) but nothing in this version of the plan actually consumes
it — stated here rather than left for a reader to wonder whether omission was an oversight.

# ---- 1. The tier ladder, ordered (decision 32/33) ----------------------------------------------
# Read from data/tuning/structure-seed.v1.json's own `bands.tierLadder` (spec's own Tunables
# table) -- NOT hardcoded here a second time. `bands.tierLadder` must equal `STRENGTH_BAND`
# (schema.py's own enum) exactly; `test_tier_ladder_matches_the_schemas_strength_band` checks this
# directly so the two can never silently drift into a 7th instance of this codebase's own recurring
# "N parallel lists must stay synced" bug class. Inventing a 4th rung ("iron", per the spec's own
# illustrative "rubble < timber < stone < iron < ..." example text) without a real tuning row to
# back it would be exactly the "the model names a rung nobody declared" failure this module exists
# to prevent, aimed at itself -- extending the ladder for real is its own future content decision.

# ---- 5. acquisitionPaths legality (decision 35: `none` illegal) --------------------------------
# Every one of the 4 real paths is legal for ANY role today -- no role-specific restriction exists
# in the source material (base-defense-ideal.md §5.24 describes the four paths generically, never
# tied to a role or kind). The only illegal state, already enforced at C# load time
# (StructureCatalog.Validate), is an EMPTY list.

# ---- 4. Variant count policy (§6: "a tier chain is a variants list, not four rows") -------------
# No row in the real corpus has authored any variant yet (structure-corpus, module 24) -- an honest
# floor, not a placeholder. The policy is a bound, not a forced count: 0 is always legal (most rows
# need none), and a future row MAY declare variants up to this bound without a plan change.

# material axis can express, the same reasoning spec-structure-corpus.md §2 uses for "two tiers by
# value" staying inside strengthBand rather than becoming separate rows.

# ---- 6. Container policy (a real gap `structure-instantiate` (26) found, not this spec's own text)
# structure-instantiate's own spec-structure-instantiate.md §1 table names HP/cost/footprint/reach
# as never rolled -- but says nothing about WHO assigns a structure's ContainerId, and neither this
# module's own original 5-decision list nor structure-pipeline's (28) 28.1-28.6 named it either
# (grepped both specs directly before writing this. Zero mentions). Declared here as the missing
# sixth decision: containers are OPT-IN, assigned by a human/deterministic tool reviewing a row
# AFTER it exists (never by the model that names the row, and never automatically at generation
# time) -- the same "model writes identity, deterministic code writes magnitude/mechanism" split
# Law 2 already establishes for numbers, extended to "which container" since a container is a
# mechanism choice, not flavour. No row is required to ever get one.
