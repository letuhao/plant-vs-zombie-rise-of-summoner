"""base-defense `structure-corpus` (module 24, spec-structure-corpus.md). **Zero model calls, zero
tokens** — every row below is hand-authored, citing `base-defense-ideal.md` §5.18 (the obstacle
vocabulary) or §5.21 (the ten economic roles), or transcribed from `StructureCatalog.cs`'s own
already-shipped `Seed` array (task 24.1's "dump the shipped rows first" importer proof).

**A real, honestly-named drift from the spec's own text, found by reading code rather than trusting
the spec (`docs/DESIGN-GATE.md`'s own rule):** spec-structure-corpus.md (written 2026-09-04) says
"`StructureCatalog`'s four rows" — but by the time this module was built (2026-09-06), the shipped
catalog had grown to **eight** rows (`soul-conduit`/`extractor`/`hatchery` — all `Yield`-kind, added
by `loam-structures`/`world-map` waves the spec's own "what already exists" section never
mentions — plus `moat`, the first `Obstacle`-kind row, added THIS SESSION by `siege-construction`
15.3b). All eight are dumped here, not four.

**A second, consequent and equally honest drift:** with 8 already-dumped (not 4), reaching the
spec's own literal "~36 hand-authored" text on top would push grid density to 4.4/cell — outside
the very 2.4-4.0 safe band §4 computes and cites as the reason for the ~36 target in the first
place. This module targets the **band**, not the literal row count: 17 new rows (not ~36), landing
the TOTAL corpus (8 dumped + 17 new = 25) at exactly 2.5/cell — inside the safe band, and grounded
in real source material rather than padded with invented filler to hit a number written when the
dumped count was smaller. See `tasks/base-defense-todo.md` 24.1/24.2's own evidence for the full
accounting.

**File shape**, one per row under ``data/seed/structures/<role-lowercase>/<structureId>.json``,
matching ``seedsmith.corpus.Corpus.load``'s own generic ``{"kind", "_meta", "entries"}`` contract
(the shared corpus-loading SDK already used by the actions adapter — Law 1: no second loader)::

    {
      "kind": "structure-anchor",
      "_meta": {"partition": "<Role>"},
      "entries": [
        {
          "id": "<structureId>",
          "anchor": { ...the 21 fields `build_structure_anchor_schema()` validates, verbatim... },
          "_provenance": {"source": "AUTHORED", "citation": "<where this row comes from>"},
          "magnitudes": { ...only on an import-ready row, see below... }
        }
      ]
    }

``anchor`` is kept as its own nested object (rather than flattened beside ``_provenance``)
specifically so it validates against ``build_structure_anchor_schema()`` unmodified —
that schema declares ``additionalProperties: False`` over exactly its 21 keys, so a sibling
``_provenance`` key on the SAME object would fail validation. Nesting is this module's own
resolution of a real, undocumented ambiguity (no prior spec shows a worked example row) — stated
here rather than left implicit, per this program's own "say so" discipline for a judgment call.

**``magnitudes`` — a real, undocumented gap found while building `structure-catalog-import` (module
25), not invented ahead of need.** structure-schema's own foundational rule is that the anchor
"holds no numbers at all" (Law 2: a model must never author a magnitude) — but
spec-structure-catalog-import.md §4 requires the shipped rows to produce "same cost, same yield
multiplier, same build turns, same capacity bonus" through the corpus path, and those are
per-structure, independently-tuned numbers (`data/tuning/loam.v4.json`'s own `structures` block —
`wellCost` 200 ≠ `granaryCost` 150 ≠ `waystationCost` 300, etc.) that no shared ordinal band (a
single `costProfile` value shared by many rows) could ever reproduce. See
`docs/architecture/base-defense/spec-structure-catalog-import.md`'s own new correction section for
the full reasoning. Resolution: a THIRD, sibling key, ``magnitudes`` — present only on a row that is
actually ready to be loaded as a real `StructureDef` (today: the 8 dumped rows, since their numbers
already exist and are exactly transcribed here). The 17 new anchor-only rows carry no
``magnitudes`` yet on purpose — they are identity-registered, not yet catalog-loadable, until
`structure-planner` (27) assigns each a real, deterministic number (never a model's own guess, per
Law 2) and the resulting row gains its own ``magnitudes`` block then. `magnitudes.materialTier` is
authored explicitly (never derived from `anchor.strengthBand`) for exactly the reason
spec-structure-catalog-import.md §4 itself states: the loam rows "author tier zero" (indestructible)
even though `strengthBand` (not nullable, no zero-tier value in its 3-rung vocabulary) carries a
real band — the two fields answer different questions and only `magnitudes.materialTier` is
authoritative for `StructureDef.MaterialTier` once a row has one.
