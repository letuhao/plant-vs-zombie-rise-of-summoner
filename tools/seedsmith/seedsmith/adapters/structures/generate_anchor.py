"""base-defense `structure-pipeline` (module 28, spec-structure-pipeline.md). **The first model call
in the entire base-defense program.** Reuses three already-shipped, already-tested SDK pieces
verbatim (Law 1 — no second implementation of any of them):

- `seedsmith.adapters.demons.anchor.permute.order_for` — deterministic per-`(entity_id, field,
  sample_index)` enum shuffling (`sampleIndex` INSIDE the seed, or three votes are one sample with
  extra steps).
- `seedsmith.adapters.demons.anchor.vote.resolve_vote` / `resolve_set_vote` — majority-vote
  resolution, `1-1-1` -> `unresolved`, never option one; the SET variant closes the exact
  "whole-value equality discards real per-member agreement" bug `[[affix-authoring-vote-bug]]`
  already found and fixed for a different pipeline.
- `seedsmith.pipeline.llm_caller.call_model` / `LlmCallerConfig` — the local OpenAI-compatible
  transport with constrained decoding (`schema=`) already measured and proven (2026-09-01, against
  the SAME default model this module also targets).

This module's own new work is narrow: which fields on the structure anchor are vote-worthy (27's own
`voteFields`, reused directly rather than re-declared), the structure-specific prompt, and the
generation-time-only n-gram guard.
