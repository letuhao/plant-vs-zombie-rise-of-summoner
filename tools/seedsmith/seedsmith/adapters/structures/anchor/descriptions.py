"""Prose for every structure anchor attribute (base-defense `structure-schema`, module 23,
spec-structure-schema.md §1) — the reliability mechanism, not documentation. Each description
states what the field means, what distinguishes it from its nearest neighbour, and an explicit
**negative clause**: what the field is *not*. Ports `adapters/demons/anchor/descriptions.py`'s own
convention verbatim onto the structure anchor's 17-field contract.

Edited far more often than schema.py's shape, which is why it lives in its own module.

        "What this structure is for, on the ten-role vocabulary (Extract, Refine, Multiply, "
        "Store, Move, Bank, Enable, Defend, See, Deny). This is NOT which engine path reads it — "

    "roleSecondary": (
        "A second role this structure leans on, or 'none' if its purpose is singular. NOT a "

    "elementPrimary": (
        "The element this structure is attuned to (fire, ice, air, earth, light, dark), or 'none' "
