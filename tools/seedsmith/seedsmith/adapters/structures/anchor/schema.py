"""The structure anchor schema (base-defense `structure-schema`, module 23, spec-structure-schema.md).
Seventeen design-variable fields (plus `structureId`/`family`/`reason` bookkeeping the ideal doc's
own count did not include, and two DERIVED fields — the identical "N keys for M design variables"
shape `adapters/demons/anchor/schema.py`'s own top comment already documents for the species anchor).
**The anchor holds no numbers at all.**

Ports `adapters/demons/anchor/schema.py`'s exact pattern (`_enum_prop`/`_flag_array_prop`/
`_open_array_prop` helpers, an OWNERSHIP dict, `additionalProperties: False`, `required` = every
key) onto the structure anchor's own 17-field contract, with two additions the demon precedent never
needed: a per-row `_provenance.source` (AUTHORED vs GENERATED — structures mix hand-authored and
model-written rows in one corpus; demons never did) and `ROLE_TO_STRUCTURE_KIND`, the P3-6 mapping
from this module's own 10-role vocabulary to the shipped 3-value `StructureKind` C# enum.
