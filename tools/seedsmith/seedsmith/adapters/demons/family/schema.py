"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.family.schema — the family-extraction response schema
(spec-family-extract.md §2.3, §2.5).

A response covers ONE BATCH. `candidates` holds an entry per (demon, label) pair the model
proposed — a demon may appear zero, one or several times (multi-membership, owner 2026-08-31); a
demon that appears zero times is `blocked` (§2.3), and `blocked` is therefore represented by
ABSENCE from this array, never by a per-candidate flag, because there is nothing to attach a flag
to. `basis` here is only ever `text` or `name` for exactly that reason — `blocked` never appears as
a candidate value.

`speciesId` on each candidate is what lets the caller reject a label for a demon that was never in
the batch (§6's own test row) without trusting the model to have stayed in scope.
