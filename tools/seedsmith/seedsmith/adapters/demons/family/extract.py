Not built on `briefkit.render_brief`: that function's shape is "author N new entries against a
target", carrying a `Job`/budget/id-template — this pipeline reads EXISTING text and proposes
labels, a genuinely different job (§2.1's own words). The brief-building here is bespoke, but the
inlining discipline is not: it is checked against the SAME `briefkit.CITATION_PATTERNS`, not a
re-invented pattern set, so the two disciplines cannot drift apart.
