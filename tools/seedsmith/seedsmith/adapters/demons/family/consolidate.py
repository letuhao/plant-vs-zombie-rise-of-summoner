"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.family.consolidate — candidate labels -> the family vocabulary
(spec-family-consolidate.md).

Runs over `family-extract`'s COMMITTED output only, never live extraction (§2.0/§7 boundaries) —
the input to this module is a fixed, already-recorded set of candidates, which is what makes
"same inputs -> byte-identical vocabulary, forever" (§2.1) a provable claim rather than a hope.

Merging reads `label` (English) only; `nativeLabel` is carried into the family record for display
and `lore-enrich`, and never participates in grouping (§2.0, resolving audit S7).

# Expanded 2026-08-31 after the FIRST REAL model run exposed the original 5-word set as too narrow.
# `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-qat`, unprompted, produced labels like `fire-based`, `light-based`,
# `chomper-kin`, `nut-kin`, `pea-kin`, `ice-attackers`, `bucket-users`, `sun-producers` — every one
# a "<theme>-<generic relational noun>" shape the original 5 words did not cover. Left unfixed, this
# produced BOTH failure directions at once on the same 53-candidate batch: semantically IDENTICAL
# groups split apart (`ice-attackers` and `ice-family` became two separate families instead of one),

# "based" family; `chomper-kin`+`nut-kin`+`pea-kin` -> one false "kin" family). The false-merge
# direction is the more dangerous of the two — it silently combines things that are not kin, which
# is exactly what audit A6 named this module to prevent.
