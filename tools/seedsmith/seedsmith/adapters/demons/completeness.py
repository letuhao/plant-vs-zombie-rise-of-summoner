"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.completeness — adopting `content-completeness-core` for demon
species (spec-content-completeness-demons.md, `seedsmith-content-standard` Task 10).

Two real, separate things this module does — both grounded in code already read, not assumed:

1. **`corpus.model.Corpus.load()` cannot see `data/seed/demons/species/**/*.json` at all.** It only
   recognises a file whose TOP-LEVEL JSON has both a `kind` string and an `entries` LIST
   (`corpus/model.py:183-186`). A species anchor file is a bare JSON ARRAY of rows
   (`anchor/emit.py`'s own `render_family_file`: `json.dumps(sorted_entries, ...)` — no wrapper at
   all), unlike `demon`/`commander-effect` kind files under this SAME adapter root, which already
   are real `{kind, entries}` documents and load correctly today. So registering a
   `CompletenessSpec` for `kind="species"` alone would be reachable in the registry and silently
   inert — `ctx.corpus.by_kind("species")` returns `[]` even against the real, full 904-entry
   corpus. `load_species_corpus` below is this domain's own local corpus builder, mirroring
   `adapters/dungeon/completeness.py`'s `load_dungeon_corpus` (the live precedent for exactly this
   gap, found while grounding this module) — it reuses the real `Corpus`/`Entry` classes UNCHANGED
   (`content-completeness-core`'s own boundary: never edit a shared module for one domain's storage
   convention) and is ADDITIVE, not a replacement: `demon`/`commander-effect` entries already parse
   through the generic loader, so this only adds the one kind that does not.

2. **No demon-species entry, of the real, committed 904, carries any player-facing description or
   flavor field today** — confirmed by enumerating every key across every one of the 904 real
   entries under `data/seed/demons/species/`: the union is `_derived`, `_provenance`, `acquisition`,
   `aptitudePrimary`, `aptitudeSecondary`, `attackTempo`, `basis`, `deployMode`, `elementPrimary`,
   `elementSecondary`, `family`, `gameTypeId`, `posture`, `pure`, `rarity`, `reach`, `reason`,
   `resourceProfile`, `side`, `speciesId`, `targetPreference`, `threatBand`, `traits`, `variants`,
   `verdict` — no `name`, `flavor`, `description`, or `lore` anywhere. The one free-text field,
   `reason`, is explicitly NOT a flavor/description field: it is the threat-classification model's
   own audit trail for why it picked a threat rung (`anchor/prompts.py:242-246`'s own prompt:
   "Choose one: ..., with a one-sentence reason"), and its real values are laced with the exact raw
   mechanical vocabulary this program's OWN commander-effect precedent (`generate_commander_effects.
   py`'s G1 motif-prose filter) treats as disqualifying for player-facing text — e.g. the real,
   committed `PotatoMine.reason`: "A single explosion dealing 1800 damage with a radius of 0.74
   blocks..." This module therefore registers `field="flavor"` — a genuinely NEW field, matching
   this program's own universal naming convention (`Quality/FlavourMissing`'s items, dungeon's
   event `flavor`, passive-tree's node `flavor`) — and `Content/FieldMissing` correctly reports
   904/904 missing until a real species-flavor generator exists (out of this module's own scope,
   which is the metric + backfill wiring per this program's module map, not a new generation stage).

`missing_species_ids` (below) is the backfill-wiring half of this task: it proves the SHARED
engine's automatic path (`pipeline.backfill.plan_missing`) produces the identical id list to
`run/runner.py`'s own real, live, already-shipped resumability
(`start()`'s `already_done = {a["speciesId"] for a in existing_anchors}` /
`ids = [i for i in ids if i not in already_done]`) — so demons' species-anchor generation is
provably equivalent to the resolved missing-only-automatic contract (spec-content-completeness-
core.md §3), not a seventh independent reimplementation of it. `runner.py` itself is left
untouched: it is a complex, live, production module (locking, threading, crash recovery) and this
task's own scope is proving the shared engine generalizes to it, not rewriting it.
