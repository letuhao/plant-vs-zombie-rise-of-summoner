"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.kinds — the four demons-adapter KindSpecs, plus per-kind motif
expression rules (spec-adapter-demons.md §2.2, §2.7).

`item` and `action` are deliberately ABSENT (audit A3): `Corpus.load` is single-root, so a demon
"item" here would be a different thing from a real item -- unequippable, outside the item corpus's
own role/frame/affix rules. A demon is a THEME; items and actions stay in their own corpus and
reference it (`demon-themes`, wave D4). `test_adapter_demons.py` asserts this absence directly.

`id_pattern`/`runtime_id_fields` left unset for every kind, matching `adapters/items/kinds.py`'s
own documented reason: `speciesId` is already stable kebab-case, and no acceptance criterion here
exercises the pattern (spec-adapter-demons.md §8 Q1, decided 2026-08-31).
