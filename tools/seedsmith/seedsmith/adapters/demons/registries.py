"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.registries — closed vocabularies for the demons feature.

Unlike `adapters/items/registries.py`, there is no committed JSON registry to read fresh: the
frozen vocabularies here mirror C# enums (`DemonRarity.cs`, `ActorElementTypes.cs`,
`DemonSpeciesCatalog.cs`, `DemonTraitCatalog.cs`), which is exactly the "code, not data" case
`adapters/items/kinds.py`'s own docstring already established a precedent for: transcribed once,
with a citation, because there is no JSON file that states the same fact. Read the cited file
fresh if this ever drifts — `test_adapter_demons.py` pins the exact counts so a future enum change
that isn't ported here fails loudly rather than silently.

`family` and `motif` are append-only and genuinely EMPTY in D1 — no registry file exists for them
yet (`family-consolidate`/`motif-derive` are D2). Declaring the keys now with empty sets, rather
than omitting them, is what lets `dimensions()` fall back to `side/rarity` partitioning honestly
(spec-demon-corpus-emit.md §9 Q1) instead of the adapter pretending to a grouping it cannot supply.

# Citations, read 2026-08-31 — RARITY/DEPLOY_MODE ids are transcribed VERBATIM from an existing
# string-id producer; the rest have no id-string producer anywhere in the codebase (the enums are
# consumed as .NET names or flattened to booleans) and are kebab-cased by inference from the
# sibling conventions that DO exist, flagged as such rather than presented as a direct citation:
#   src/FusionRpg.Core/Demons/DemonRarity.cs:30      — DemonRarityIds.ToId(), the literal source
#   src/FusionRpg.Server/DemonEndpoints.cs:29        — the literal source for "plant-avatar"/"hypno-ally"
#   src/FusionRpg.Core/Demons/DemonRarity.cs:13-19   — DemonAcquisition enum names (INFERRED kebab-case;
#                                                       no id-string producer exists — DemonEndpoints.cs:30-31
#                                                       flattens it to booleans instead of emitting a string id)
#   src/FusionRpg.Core/Stats/Derived/ActorElementTypes.cs — ElementRoster.Concrete (+ OmniId, literal)
#   src/FusionRpg.Core/Demons/DemonSpeciesCatalog.cs — KnownVariants (literal strings already)

# `acquisition` is a REGISTRY vocabulary only, never a `dimensions()` entry: `DemonAcquisition` is

# one-value-per-entry shape — spec-adapter-demons.md §2.1's dimensions table already omits it,
# listing only side/rarity/element/family.

# `Coverage/EmptyPartition` (spec-demon-corpus-emit.md §9 Q1's own stated reason to pick a
# partition key) reads `registries().vocabularies["partitions"]` as the ALLOCATED set and diffs it
# against what the corpus actually occupies — omitting this key silently disables the metric
# (`.get(..., frozenset())` makes `allocated - occupied` always empty, never a false negative you'd
# notice, which is worse than a crash). All 8 side×rarity combinations are legal (the only
# `legal_combinations()` rule this adapter declares is about element×rarity, not side×rarity), so
# all 8 are allocated — a demon-count-driven roster is expected to leave some empty, and that is
# real signal `EmptyPartition` should report, not something to hide by allocating fewer.
