"""Ties `machine.py`/`selectors.py` to the eight `classify-pipelines` graphs into one
species-at-a-time run (demon-seed module 9, spec-run-control.md §1-2), permuting every
enum-bearing pipeline and majority-voting the five load-bearing fields
(spec-option-permutation.md — module 6, Q8/Q25).

**Pause is checked only BETWEEN species, never mid-species** (§2's explicit warning: "a species
half-classified across eight pipelines is not a resumable unit... an anchor with four fields from
before the pause and four from after, with two different prompt versions in one entry").

Found live (2026-09-02, a real 3-species proof run): `permute.py`/`vote.py` existed, fully tested,
with ZERO real callers anywhere in the codebase — every classification was a single unpermuted
sample, exactly the label/position-bias failure mode module 6 exists to prevent. This module is
now that caller.

    Every pipeline with a permutable field (`_PERMUTABLE_FIELD` / basis-conditional threat-audit)
