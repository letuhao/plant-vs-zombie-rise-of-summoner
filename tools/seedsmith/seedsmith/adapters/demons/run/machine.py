"""The `run-control` state machine (demon-seed module 9, spec-run-control.md §2). Pure — states
and legal transitions with no I/O — so every transition is testable without a database.

# A user pause is TRANSIENT, not QUALITY: resume replays the checkpoint and makes no new
# call. Blurring this makes pausing cost money and change answers - runner.py's own
# docstring is the reason, and it costs $150 to learn the other way.
