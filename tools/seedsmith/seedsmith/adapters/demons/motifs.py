"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.motifs — motifs and anti-motifs per demon (spec-motif-derive.md).

Pure derivation, no model call, no human pass (owner, Q1) — the point is not sophistication, it is
a mechanism a family member can inherit from and a later pass (`lore-enrich`) can improve without
anyone re-authoring by hand. §2.5's own words: "first-pass motifs... are supposed to be visibly
weak" — this module is deliberately naive, not accidentally so.

Two passes, because a family's own motif pool does not exist until its MEMBERS' own-text motifs
have been derived once:
  pass 1 — `own_motifs(text_or_name)` per demon, independent of family
  pass 2 — aggregate each family's pool from its members' pass-1 motifs
  pass 3 — each demon's final motifs = its families' pools (family-first) + its own, trimmed 3-5

⚠️ **`jieba` dependency, owner-approved 2026-08-31, scoped to this module's tokenizer only.** The
program's standing rule is "stdlib only outside `pipeline`" — this is the one exception, and here is
why a regex genuinely cannot do the job it is standing in for: Chinese has no spaces between words,
so a punctuation-free run of characters is not "one token", it is an un-segmented CLAUSE. Confirmed
on the first real 84-demon run: the original regex tokenizer (`[一-鿿]+`, "maximal CJK run") returned
whole sentences as "motifs" — e.g. `以下能防止爆炸樱桃产生溅射` (an entire clause) — which is unusable
as shared vocabulary. `jieba` performs real dictionary/statistical word segmentation; no
regex-based heuristic can approximate that without linguistic knowledge a regex does not have.

#
# Measured over the real 84-demon corpus: 70% of `flavorInfo` is a STAT TABLE, only 29% prose. The
# derivation was therefore reading `韧性：270+2200（一类）` and emitting `一类` ("armour-class one")
# as a "motif". Four rules, all structural — a balance pass would never touch them.
#
# Rules 3 and 4 were added by audit S1: the first draft said "section headers and their continuation
# lines" WITHOUT DEFINING a continuation line, and leaked 15 of 99 supposedly-prose lines.

#: Rule 1 — `label：value`. The <=12-char bound separates a field label from a sentence that merely
#: contains a colon; structural, not tunable.
_STAT_LINE = re.compile(r"^\s*[^：:]{1,12}[：:]")

#: Rule 2 — mechanical section headers.
_MECHANICAL_HEADERS = ("特点", "特性", "弱点", "使用条件", "融合配方")

#: Rule 3 — a circled numeral opens the CONTINUATION of a 特点 list. This is the definition the
#: first draft hand-waved (13 real lines leaked through without it).
_CIRCLED_NUMERALS = "①②③④⑤⑥⑦⑧⑨⑩⑪⑫"

#: Rule 4 — an ASCII digit means threshold/stat text. DELIBERATELY ASCII-only: `可在三种攻击模式之间切换`
#: uses the CJK numeral 三, is genuinely thematic, and must survive. A rule matching CJK numerals
#: would delete real prose.

# ---- G1.2: part-of-speech filtering (spec-motif-prose-filter.md §2.2) -------------------------
#
# Audit S3 measured that a corpus-FREQUENCY floor is the wrong instrument and fails in BOTH
# directions: `为什么` ("why") has document frequency 3/84 so a floor KEEPS it, while `樱桃`
# ("cherry", 9/84) and `坚果` ("nut", 7/84) are real family motifs a floor would risk DROPPING.
# Connectives are rare-but-meaningless; family words are common-but-meaningful.
#
# Part of speech separates them cleanly, verified on the exact failing narrative:
#   KEEP  铁桶/n 坚果/n 核桃/n 补脑/n 含铁/n 练成/v 铁头功/n
#   DROP  为什么/r 其实/d 是因为/c 但是/c 不过/c 也许/d 至少/d 现在/t
# ⛔ `l` (习用语, colloquial set phrase) is DELIBERATELY ABSENT — measured 2026-09-01, it was the
# single remaining hole in this filter. jieba tags multi-character narrative connectives as `l`, so
# they survived POS filtering and became motifs: `从那之后` ("from then on"), `发现自己`
# ("discovered oneself"), `一段时间` ("a period of time"), `随处可见` ("seen everywhere"),
# `毋庸置疑` ("undoubtedly"), `更进一步`, `并不知道`, `很难说`, `不多见` — 9 of the 11
# `l`-tagged motifs in the corpus were pure scaffolding.
#
# This is not cosmetic. `motif_coverage` REQUIRES a motif to appear in the generated text, so a junk
# motif becomes MANDATORY junk in committed content: `normalzombie` shipped named 「随处可见的消耗」
# ("Ubiquitous Attrition") and `flagzombie`'s doctrine forced in 「毋庸置疑的指令」. All 7 passed
# every gate — the same "a pass rate is not quality" failure this program keeps re-learning.
#
# The cost is 2 real motifs (`无人机` "drone", `绕道而行` "detour around"), accepted because a motif is
# a MANDATORY creative seed: a bad one corrupts output, a missing one costs nothing when the demon
# still has others. `i` (成语) is kept — idioms like `人心惶惶` are evocative, not scaffolding.
