#: Q25 — three-way voted, load-bearing fields. Adding or removing one is an "ask first" boundary
#: (moves the call budget) — pinned here as a frozenset so a change needs deliberate code, not a
#: silent list edit. `attackTempo` joined 2026-09-04 (demon-corpus-self-heal C1, owner-approved as
#: part of the full self-heal plan): the real 833-species audit found it collapsed to a single
#: value (entropy 0.00) — the one pipeline (`kit-shape`) that had never been wired into voting or
#: permutation at all, unlike every other classified field.

    **Why this exists (measured, 2026-09-05).** `resolve_vote` is scalar: it compares whole values
    with `Counter` equality. A set-valued field reaching it has to be flattened to one string first
    (the action pipelines' own `canonical_family_key`), so `{a,b}` / `{a,c}` / `{a,d}` scores as a
    1-1-1 split — *unresolved* — even though `a` was chosen unanimously by all three samples. Every
    member-level agreement is discarded by the flattening. Over a ~98-option pool with multi-member
    picks, exact whole-set agreement across three independent samples is combinatorially unlikely,
    which is why the real action-corpus batches measured a 40-55% unresolved rate that five rounds
    of prompt work could not move: the ceiling was in the aggregation, not the model.

    **The rule.** A member joins the resolved set when at least a majority of `sample_count`
    samples chose it (2 of 3). The denominator is always `sample_count`, never "samples that
    answered" — a heal-exhausted sample (`None`) still counts against the threshold, the identical
    discipline the callers' own unresolved-sample sentinel already enforced, and for the same
    reason: dropping it would let two samples out-vote a total of two instead of three.

    **It can never fall back to one sample.** A member needs two independent samples to enter the
    set, which is strictly stronger per-member evidence than whole-set equality ever gave. An empty
    result is `unresolved` — the genuine ambiguity signal, never sample 0's raw pick.
