"""The legacy diff (demon-seed module 8, spec-anchor-emit.md §6, T2.7) — compares the new
re-derivation against what the old C# generator (`DemonSpeciesCatalog.Generated.cs`) assigned for
the shipped 84 species, field by field. **A disagreement is not automatically wrong** — the old
generator assigned elements by a hash, not by reading anything — this is the sanity check
available before 820 more species are trusted, not a correctness gate.

Deliberately does not read `DemonSpeciesCatalog.Generated.cs` itself here: that is a C# source
file, and parsing it from Python is exactly the kind of fragile, unreviewable coupling this
program avoids elsewhere (`no SQL in tools/`, `canonical bytes only`). The legacy side is passed
in as plain dicts — a small future export step (or a one-off read) produces those, this module
only computes and reports the comparison.
