"""The threat-audit review queue (demon-seed module 7, pipeline 5 `threat-audit`,
spec-classify-pipelines.md §3). A `too-low`/`too-high` verdict never overrides the computed rung
(Q16: "number wins") — it only enters this queue, which `roster-metrics` (module 14) reports and a
human (or a retune of `demon-threat.v1.json`) resolves. seedsmith's own open-loop rule: a metric
that cannot verify its own fix produces a queue, never a silent pass.
