"""seedsmith.adapters.demons — the demons feature (seedsmith-map.md §3b, feature 2), wired to
`data/seed/demons/`. spec-adapter-demons.md.

**Done means:** `StubAdapter`-shaped, `ItemsAdapter`-sized. `channels()` is empty — demons carry no
magnitude (rarity is a band, Theta comes from the power ladder), so `numerics` stays inert for this
feature by construction, not by convention (audit A4).
