"""Real-run entrypoint for the family sub-pipeline (D2.1 extract + D2.2 consolidate).

**Why this exists.** Until now the family pipeline had *no committed entrypoint at all* — `extract.py`
and `consolidate.py` were library modules whose only callers were tests. The 2026-08-31 real run used
scratch scripts that live nowhere, so `family-candidates.json`, `families.v1.json` and
`family-assignments.json` were committed artifacts **nothing in the repo could reproduce**.

That is the third instance of one defect: G1.3 recorded it for motifs (*"There was no committed
generation entrypoint at all"*) and G4.3 fixed it for commander effects. This closes it for families.

⛔ **The append-only window is CLOSED, and this tool refuses accordingly.**

G1.3's own note said regeneration was safe *"only because nothing is bound to them — all 84 demons
currently have zero generated content. **This window closes when G4 writes its first row.**"*
G4 has since written 84 commander effects, and the chain below is now load-bearing:

    families → motifs (inherit family pools) → themes (embed motifs) → commander effects
                                                                       (generated FROM motifs)

So a family id that moves or disappears silently invalidates committed, append-only content three
layers downstream. `--write` therefore refuses unless `--i-have-read-the-append-only-note` is also
passed, and consolidation always runs append-only against the existing registry.

Usage:
    python -m seedsmith.adapters.demons.generate_families --dry-run   # batches + brief, no calls
    python -m seedsmith.adapters.demons.generate_families             # runs, prints, writes nothing
