"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.commander_effect — the first real per-demon generator (G4).

A commander effect is a DOCTRINE: how this demon's squad behaves in battle. The per-kind
expression rule comes from `adapter-demons`' own `KindSpec.motif_expression`, inlined literally
into the brief and never cited (audit A1: five generators handed the same motifs without expression
rules produce a thesaurus, with every check passing).

⛔ **Depends on G1 having landed.** Generating from the pre-filter motifs (`一类` = "armour-class
one", `伤害` from a stat row) would bake stat vocabulary into committed, append-only content. That
is a **Never** in spec-commander-effect.md §7, not a preference.
