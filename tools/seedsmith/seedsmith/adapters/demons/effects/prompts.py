"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.effects — species-effects' own domain knowledge (T5.3,
spec-species-effects.md). Turns one species anchor into a `species-passive.{speciesId}` container
seed: the model judges WHICH affix families this species is eligible for and an affinity ordinal
per pick (`core`/`likely`/`occasional`); everything numeric — the fixed-core band, the pool weight
per affinity, `prefix_rolls`/`suffix_rolls` — is a TABLE, never the model (spec §3, §6).

**`threatBand` is deliberately absent from every context this module builds.** Strength is
`species-generator`'s, through one `P(Θ)` (spec §2's own table: "`threatBand` constrains nothing.
It is a `Θ` offset, so it belongs to magnitude, not to membership."). Grepping this file for
"threatBand" finds nothing outside this docstring — the property is enforced by omission, not by a
check that could itself have a bug.

    ⛔ **Fixed 2026-09-06 — the shape below never matched the real C# `ReadContainer`/
    `ContainerPoolRow`/`ContainerValidator` reader, found only because this task actually ran real
    content through the real importer rather than stopping at the in-process tests (the exact "never
    round-tripped through the real seed-file reader" trap `affix-authoring`'s own sibling `entry_for`
    already hit once, 2026-09-05). Three real mismatches, not one:**
    1. `ReadContainer` has no `fixedAffixes` field at all — a container's always-present half is its
       `atoms` list (`{"seq", "atom"}` objects, `effect_container_atom` at import — spec §4's own
       table: "`core` | `effect_container_atom` — always present"). A `core` affinity therefore
       flattens into ITS OWN real atom refs via `affix_refs_of` (looked up from the real committed
       affix catalog), not a bare affix id — the container never stores "this affix is fixed," only
       the atoms that make it so, mirroring exactly how a hand-authored container like `patron.aura`
       lists raw atoms directly.
    2. `ContainerPoolRow` is `(AffixId, Weight, Group)` — a real int `Weight` is REQUIRED to be a
       legal pool row at all, not "resolved at roll time": `SpeciesMaterialiser`/`Instantiator.Draw`
       have no independent path to `demon-species-effects.v1.json`'s own tuning at roll time, so
       spec §6's "no weight... resolved downstream" describes the MODEL never inventing a number
       (P1), not the committed container having none — the model still only ever writes an
       `affinity` ordinal; this function is what turns that ordinal into the real, table-derived,
       non-invented weight via `pool_affinity_weight_milli` (`demon-species-effects.v1.json`'s own
       `poolAffinityWeightMilli`), the same "table converts a judgement into a number, the model
       never does" contract every other tunable table in this program already uses.
    3. `ContainerValidator.Validate` derives a pool row's default `Group` (PoE's "at most one per
       group" mod-family rule) from a SOLE concrete ref's own `(family, variant)` — it has nothing to
       derive from for a multi-ref bundle and refuses the whole import rather than guess (found live,
       running this exact output through the real importer). Every pool row whose affix has more
       than one ref now names its own affix id as `group` explicitly — safe and non-colliding, since
       each named bundle is already its own atomic pick.

    `prefixRolls`/`suffixRolls` are the count of drawable pool groups per budget the pool ACTUALLY
    needs to cover its own `likely`/`occasional` entries — a `Mixed`-class affix counts against BOTH
    budgets simultaneously (A1), never doubling either count and never omitted from either.
