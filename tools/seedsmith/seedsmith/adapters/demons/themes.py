"""seedsmith.adapters.demons.themes — the theme registry demons publish for items/actions
(spec-demon-themes.md).

Direction is one-way and it matters (§2.2): this module builds a registry FROM demon motif data;
nothing here reads an item, and nothing in the items corpus writes a demon. The items side of the
bridge is exactly one edit — `adapters/items/registries.py` gains `themeKey` as a registry-backed
vocabulary — and that is the ONE file outside `adapters/demons/` this feature is allowed to touch
(§4; matches `spec-adapter-demons.md`'s own single permitted exception, §D-F1).
