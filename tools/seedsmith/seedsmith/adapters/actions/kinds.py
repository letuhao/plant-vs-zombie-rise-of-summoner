"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.kinds — the ten `action-corpus` KindSpecs (spec-corpus-loader.md §2).

Only `action-seed`'s shape is specified by this module's own spec (§3 step 4) — `required` /
`optional` / `reference_fields` transcribed verbatim, post the F7 correction (`atomPools` ->
`atomFamilies`, `enablesStatus` -> `pairedPayoffFamily`, `pairingRole` moved into `required`
because `none` is a value, never an omission). The other nine kinds are owned by whichever module
writes them (A-S1/A-S2/A-S3/A-S5/A-S6/A-T1/A-S0) — this loader only needs their `id_pattern` so
`discover_edges` can record a reference TO one of their ids, so their `required`/`optional` stay at
the common `{id}` floor. Same discipline as `adapters/items/kinds.py`'s `_undefined()` helper for a
kind with no authored shape yet (there: `attribute`; here: nine of the ten).

`id_pattern` is a PER-KIND field, not one shared pattern for the whole adapter (the spec's own F
correction, from review): a single `action.`-only pattern would silently drop every cross-kind edge
for the other nine kinds, because `Corpus.discover_edges` only records an edge where the id_pattern
it was CALLED WITH matches (`corpus/model.py:154`) — and `load.load_committed` calls it once per
kind (§2: "discover_edges is called once per kind with that kind's pattern").
