"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.brief_assembly.derive — spec-brief-assembly.md §3's whole contract.
Pure derivation; the one file that touches disk is the sibling entrypoint
`../generate_brief_assembly.py`, matching every `derive.py` in this adapter family.

**What this module is, stated plainly (spec §1).** A-S1 builds every P1/P2 brief from static
inputs, in a token-free phase, before any model has run. A-P3's brief is different — it carries
`familyActions`, the accepted, deduped, id-assigned output of its own family's A-P2 round, which by
construction cannot exist at the moment A-S1 runs. Nobody owned assembling THAT brief; this module
is the named owner (`spec-signature-propose.md` §6, "⛔ DECIDED 2026-09-03").

**Reuse, never a second implementation (spec §3.2's own instruction).** `fingerprint` is A-S3's own
value, not a fresh one: every accepted action row is parsed through `dedup_select.derive.
parse_candidate` — the SAME validator A-S3 used to decide the row survived — and rendered through
`distribution_planner.fingerprint.render_fingerprint_string`, the one canonical joined-string
renderer every other brief-shaped field in this program already uses (`distribution_planner.
derive.plan_subject`'s own `avoidNeighbours` entries). Reusing `parse_candidate` also closes the
"never assemble from unaccepted output" rule (spec §4) as a side effect: a reject/review row is a
completely different shape (no `category`/`targetMode`/`atomFamilies`), so it fails inside
`parse_candidate` before this module ever considers including it — the mechanism is the SAME
closed-vocabulary parser that gated the row into `data/seed/actions/` in the first place, not a
second, independently-written acceptance check.
