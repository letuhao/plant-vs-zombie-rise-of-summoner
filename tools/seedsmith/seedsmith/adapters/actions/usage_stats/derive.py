"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.usage_stats.derive --- FC1 `usage-stats`
(spec-usage-stats.md, roster-balance program).

Measures how evenly the three propose pipelines (`general_propose`/`family_propose`/
`signature_propose`) actually draw from the 98 authored atom/affix families
(`data/seed/items/affix-families/*.json`). Nothing else in this repo does this:
`coverage_report.derive.atom_family_namespace_findings` validates that a picked family id is one of
the 98 -- it has never tallied how OFTEN each one is picked, which is the question this module
answers. Measured directly, 2026-09-06, over every real committed round: 216 accepted candidates,
59 of 98 families ever used, 39 never used, top-10 families = 45.1% of every pick.

Pure and model-free. Reads committed round files and the family corpus; writes nothing.
