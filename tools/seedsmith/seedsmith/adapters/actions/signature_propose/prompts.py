"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.signature_propose.prompts --- A-P3 "signature-propose"'s own domain
knowledge (spec-signature-propose.md SS2, action-corpus module). The model authors THE ONE action
that makes a single creature unlike its siblings in the same family: a name, a flavour line, which
atom FAMILIES it is built from, which of the SPECIES' own motifs it expresses, and -- the judgement
this whole pipeline exists to make -- the ONE axis it differs on from its family's own accepted
actions. Every magnitude of any kind -- rung, cost, cooldown, duration, chance, weight, tier, stack
count -- is a table's job, never the model's (P1, restated for this content type; see also
`general_propose/prompts.py`'s and `family_propose/prompts.py`'s own identical opening paragraph).

**A-P3 reads exactly one anchor shape: a SPECIES, plus its own family's accepted output.** Never a
bare family (that is A-P2's brief, spec SS0), and never a brief missing `familyActions` outright
(spec SS3: "A brief whose `familyActions` key is absent raises"). `build_context` raises the moment
a brief is not `scope: "species"`, or lacks the `familyActions` key A-S2 (`brief_assembly`) always
supplies on every signature brief it assembles -- silently defaulting an absent key to `[]` is
exactly how "no family round has run yet" quietly becomes "this species genuinely has no family"
(spec SS3, and `brief_assembly.derive.require_family_actions`'s own identical rule, restated here
for THIS module's own consumer side). A key present with an EMPTY list is legal and common (31 of
84 species carry no family assignment, spec-brief-assembly.md SS5 test 2) -- the two cases must
never be collapsed.

Closely mirrors `family_propose/prompts.py`'s own shape (system prompt, schema, `build_context`,
`build_brief`, `entry_for`, validators) -- named by spec-signature-propose.md SS1 as this module's
own closest structural precedent, itself modelled on `adapters/effects/affix/prompts.py`. Three
differences beyond the anchor: (1) `motifsExpressed` reads the SPECIES' own motifs, not a family's;
(2) a THIRD schema field, `differentiator` -- a single enum string, not an array, and the ONE
judgement voted alongside `atomFamilies` (spec SS2 "Which fields are voted"); (3) a hard validator
this module alone has -- a draft whose `atomFamilies` (as a SET) exactly equals any of the brief's
own `familyActions` atom-family sets is rejected and the re-prompt names the colliding action
(spec's own most novel rule for this stage).
