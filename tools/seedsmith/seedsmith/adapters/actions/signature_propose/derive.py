"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.signature_propose.derive --- A-P3's own candidate assembly: per-
sample bounded self-heal (F9's adapted contract) and majority-vote resolution over TWO fields --
`atomFamilies` AND `differentiator` (spec-signature-propose.md SS2 "Which fields are voted": "Two
voted fields this time"). Reuses `demons.anchor.vote.resolve_vote` and
`pipeline.llm_caller.call_with_self_heal` directly, never reimplemented (this whole program's own
reuse discipline) -- exactly as `family_propose/derive.py` and `general_propose/derive.py` do.

**Why TWO voted fields, and why `differentiator` is the one that matters most.** `atomFamilies` is
voted for the same reason it always is: it is the mechanical identity, and tier-1 dedup hashes it.
`differentiator` is voted ONLY here, and the argument is specific rather than inherited (spec SS2):
this is the one judgement the whole pipeline exists to make. If it is wrong, the species' signature
action is a family action with a different name -- invisible to every deterministic gate downstream,
because tiers 1/2 hash mechanics and tier 3 is advisory. A 1-1-1 split on EITHER field writes
`confidence: 'unresolved'` for the WHOLE candidate (spec SS2) -- never just the one field that split.

**`motifsExpressed` is deliberately NOT voted** (spec SS2, same reasoning as A-P2's own identical
rule): it is a self-report feeding the tier-3 review queue only, and tier 3 is advisory by design --
voting it would add cost for a field that never rejects anything. It is taken straight from sample 0
(the same "primary" sample that already supplies `name`/`flavor`/`rationale`, none of which are
voted either) -- stated once here rather than re-decided per field.

**Not a copy of `validate_heal.derive`.** A-S4 (`validate_heal`) is a LATER, separate stage that
gates and votes over whatever a generation pipeline hands it, against ITS OWN fixture schemas. This
module is the real A-P3: it owns its OWN schema (`prompts.SIGNATURE_ACTION_SCHEMA`), and it never
grades itself (spec SS3) -- so the vote/heal machinery here exists ONLY to turn three raw model
samples into one candidate row, never to decide final acceptance. `confidence` on that row is read
straight off each field's own `VoteResult`, never invented (binding constraint 4).
