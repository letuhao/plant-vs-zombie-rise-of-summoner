"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.family_propose.prompts --- A-P2 "family-propose"'s own domain
knowledge (spec-family-propose.md SS2, action-corpus module). The model authors ONE action that
expresses a whole FAMILY of creatures: a name, a flavour line, which atom FAMILIES it is built
from, and which of the family's own motifs it expresses. Every magnitude of any kind -- rung,
cost, cooldown, duration, chance, weight, tier, stack count -- is a table's job, never the
model's (P1, restated for this content type; see also `general_propose/prompts.py`'s own
identical opening paragraph).

**A-P2 reads exactly one anchor shape: a FAMILY.** Never a species, never an element, never a
per-species motif (spec SS0/SS3, "it never sees a species... that second job belongs to A-P3").
`build_context` RAISES the moment a brief carries real species-scoped anchor content rather than
silently ignoring it -- silently accepting one is exactly how "family" quietly becomes
"signature" (spec SS3). This is the MIRROR of A-P1's own `_assert_no_anchor`
(`general_propose/prompts.py:174-197`): A-P1 must see NO anchor at all and raises on any content;
A-P2 must see a FAMILY anchor specifically and raises on species-shaped content instead.

Closely mirrors `general_propose/prompts.py`'s own shape (system prompt, schema, `build_context`,
`build_brief`, `entry_for`, validators) -- named by spec-family-propose.md SS1 as this module's
own closest structural precedent, itself modelled on `adapters/effects/affix/prompts.py`. Two
differences beyond the anchor: (1) `motifsExpressed` is a SECOND schema field with its own
permuted enum (`brief.anchor.familyMotifs + "none"`), and (2) it is deliberately NOT voted (spec
SS2 "Which fields are voted") -- only `atomFamilies` is.
