"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.generate_brief_assembly — A-S2's entrypoint (spec-brief-assembly.md).
Reads:

    <plan>              A-S1's own brief envelope for this round (`distribution_planner`'s
                          output, `kind: "action-brief"`) -- quotas, rung windows, family-access
                          sets, the anchor. Every non-`familyActions` field of every emitted P3
                          brief comes from here, byte-identical (spec §4: never re-derived).
    <accepted-round>    A-P2's round, AFTER A-S4 validation and A-S3 dedup, id-assigned -- the
                          A-C1 `action-seed` envelope A-S3's own entrypoint already writes
                          (`generate_dedup_select.py`'s `survivors.json`). Never a raw/unaccepted
                          A-P2 proposal set (spec §3.1, §4).

and writes, through the A-C1 envelope:

    data/seed/actions/_rounds/round-<n>/p3-briefs.json    kind: "action-brief" -- one entry per
                                                            species-scope (signature) plan entry,
                                                            each carrying `familyActions`

**No shipped default for either input.** A-P2 (`family-propose`) is not built, so there is no real
accepted-round file anywhere in this checkout to point a default at -- the same "no shipped
default" reasoning `generate_dedup_select.py`'s own docstring already states for its own
`--candidates`. `<plan>` has a real shipped file today (`data/seed/actions/_briefs/round-1.json`)
but this module treats it the same way `generate_validate_heal.py` treats `--briefs`: named
explicitly by the caller every time, never guessed, so this entrypoint works unchanged against any
round's plan, not just round 1.

**Acceptance gating happens at the envelope's own `kind` tag.** `<accepted-round>` must carry
`kind: "action-seed"` -- exactly the tag A-S3's own `survivors.json` and A-S6's own committed-round
files carry, and exactly what `generate_dedup_select.py` (line 56-59) and `generate_innate_picker.py`
already gate their own accepted-corpus reads on. A `kind: "action-review"` / `"action-reject"`
round file -- A-S4's blocked/unresolved/escalated buckets, or A-S3's own rejects.json -- is refused
here rather than silently read as though it were accepted output.

**Zero model calls, permanently** -- there is no LLM transport import anywhere in this module or
its `brief_assembly` package (this module makes no judgement, purely mechanical assembly; spec §4's
first line, "never call a model").
