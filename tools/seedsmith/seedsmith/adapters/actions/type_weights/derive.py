`RoleLeanRow` below is this module's own narrow view of one role-lean.json entry; the parser that
builds it lives in `generate_type_weights.py`, the one file in this feature that touches disk.

**F12, restated as code rather than prose** (spec §3 step 1, §6's binding correction): the uniform
floor applies *only* when `lean_source == "floor"` — a genuine five-way score tie A-S0 itself
detected — never merely because a species carries no family. `derived-nofloor` (a family-less
species with a real, differentiated `leanOrder`) is handled by the exact same branch as `derived`
below; there is no third code path for it, which is itself the proof this module never re-opens
F12 by inventing a family-null special case of its own.

# 200/200/200/200/200 vector under the real shipped defaults — measured directly against the real
# `type-weights.json`, not a hypothetical. That directly contradicts acceptance #5's own words: "a
# family-less species still gets a vector shaped by its own leanOrder rather than a flat
# 200/200/200/200/200." The two DECIDED provisions (§2's default table and §6's AC5) could not both

# (`nullSeparationMilli`, default `500` — real signal, not the neutral 1000 `separationMilli[4]`
# carries, so a true tie (row 0, still exactly flat) and a family-less derivation (now visibly
