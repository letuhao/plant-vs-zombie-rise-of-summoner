"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.characteristic_pool.curation — the closed-trait bridge.

**The defect this module exists to fix, found by direct measurement 2026-09-11.** The action
pipeline scores a species' *traits* against the closed 14-member `DemonTraitCatalog` pool
(`TRAIT_POOL` in `catalog.py`, and `_TRAIT_CATEGORY` in `derive.py`). That was correct when the
roster was the 84-row `DemonSpeciesCatalog.Generated.cs`, whose `TraitPool` arrays held those
exact 14 ids. The roster is now the live seed folder (`data/seed/demons/species/**/*.json`), whose
`traits` field is **open, free-form flavor text** — measured 2026-09-11: **2,312 distinct tokens**
across 904 species, of which exactly **one** (`guardian`, once) is a closed-pool member. Every
other species therefore contributed **zero** trait signal, and the derivation collapsed: 673 of 904
species landed on `separation == 0` and only 11 distinct `leanOrder`s existed across the whole
roster. The per-species differentiation the whole action corpus rests on was effectively absent.

The runtime already solved this exact problem. `DemonTraitPoolCuration.PickFor(speciesId, rarity,
gameTypeId)` (`src/FusionRpg.Core/Demons/Generation/DemonTraitPoolCuration.cs`) bridges a live
species' open flavor text to the closed gameplay vocabulary, and
`ConcreteSpeciesSeedReader.cs:103` is its real caller. This module mirrors that bridge so the
Python pipeline scores the **same closed trait pool the game actually uses**, rather than a
vocabulary the live seed does not speak.

**Why this reads the frozen `.cs` rather than a committed JSON projection.** There is no committed
artifact carrying the curated pool — the curation runs in C# at snapshot-build time and is never
written to `data/generated/`. The two inputs it needs are both frozen and committed:
`DemonSpeciesLegacyTraitPoolOverlap.Generated.cs` (its own header: "Never regenerated from that
source again — it is gone. This file is now itself the frozen source of truth for this one-time
port.") and the FNV-1a fallback algorithm. `catalog.py` already establishes the precedent of
parsing a `.cs` source for a roster (`_load_legacy_catalog`), so this is the same discipline, not a
new one. The alternative — a second, hand-maintained copy of 68 species' trait pools in Python —
would drift from the C# SSOT the moment either side changed, which is the defect class this module
exists to close.

**Determinism and scope.** `curated_traits` is a pure function of `(species_id, rarity,
game_type_id)`, all three read from the live record. It invents no trait and drops no species: a
species absent from the frozen overlap map gets the same deterministic FNV pick the runtime gives
it, so the Python score and the in-game `TraitPool` agree by construction.
