"""Closed vocabularies transcribed from C#, in one leaf module so nothing can drift apart.

**Why a leaf module.** These constants are transcriptions of C# enums/arrays that have no JSON
export, so they are "code, not data" (the same discipline `adapters/demons/registries.py` states for
itself). Two callers need them — `catalog.py` (the roster loader) and `curation.py` (the trait
bridge). `catalog.py` imports `curation.py` for `curated_traits`, so `curation.py` importing
`catalog.py` back would be a cycle. A leaf module both import from breaks the cycle **and** removes
the duplicate transcription of the rarity ladder that previously existed in both files — the
2026-09-11 review's own duplication finding: a second copy of `RARITY_LADDER` with no guard, which
would silently shift `curated_traits`'s `Heirloom` threshold if the C# enum widened (and it has
widened before, 4 -> 10 rungs). One definition, imported everywhere, is the fix.

`catalog.py` re-exports `RARITY_LADDER`/`TRAIT_POOL` so every existing importer keeps working.
