"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.characteristic_pool.anchors — the classified species anchor tree
(spec §2's fifth "Reads" row: `data/seed/demons/species/**/*.json`, the optional 19-species
enrichment of posture/reach/targetPreference/attackTempo).

**A live-data finding, not a defect in this module — read before trusting any specific count.**
Spec §1 cites `data/seed/demons/species/_index.json` at "28 entries" and a four-way join of "8"
(measured 2026-09-03, the day the spec was written). As of this module's own build (same day,
later), that file is **modified but uncommitted** (`git status`: `M
data/seed/demons/species/_index.json`, plus dozens of untracked `plant/*.json` anchor files) — a
concurrent, unrelated demon-species-classification pass is actively growing the tree WHILE this
module was being written: three separate measurements taken minutes apart during this module's
own build returned three different totals (28 -> 68 -> 87 unique anchor rows), and the
catalog-matching subset moved too (19 -> 23). This loader reads whatever is on disk at run time —
never a cached snapshot — which is the only way `unjoined` can honestly satisfy step 1's "never
dropped silently, never renamed to fit". See this module's build report and
`tests/test_characteristic_pool.py`'s `AnchorTreeJoinTests` for why no test in this program pins
an exact anchor-tree literal: at this file's current update cadence, a literal would be a stale
tripwire within the same working session, not a real content-change signal.
