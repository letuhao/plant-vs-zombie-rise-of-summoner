"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.general_propose.prompts --- A-P1 "general-propose"'s own domain
knowledge (spec-general-propose.md SS2, action-corpus module). The model authors ONE role-based
action any creature could hold: a name, a flavour line, and which atom FAMILIES it is built from,
picking only from the pool the planner (A-S1) already fixed for this brief. Every magnitude of any
kind -- rung, cost, cooldown, duration, chance, weight, tier, stack count -- is a table's job,
never the model's (P1, restated for this content type).

**A-P1 is the one propose pipeline with no anchor at all.** No family, no element, no motifs, no
species (spec SS0, "why this cannot be A-P2 with a `scope` flag"). `build_context` RAISES the
moment a brief carries real anchor content rather than silently ignoring it -- silently accepting
one is exactly how "general" quietly becomes "family" (spec SS3).

Closely mirrors `adapters/effects/affix/prompts.py`'s own shape (system prompt, schema,
`build_context`, `build_brief`, `entry_for`, validators) -- named by spec-general-propose.md SS1 as
this module's own closest structural precedent. One real difference: `atomFamilies` is a VOTED
field here (three permuted samples, spec SS2 "Which fields are voted"), so `build_context` takes a
`sample_index` affix's own single-shot `build_context` never needed.

#: `data/seed/actions/_briefs/round-1.json` 2026-09-04) -- the absent-vs-empty discipline this
#: whole program already applies elsewhere (`spec-brief-assembly.md` SS3.2) means that is the
#: NORMAL, legal shape for this scope, not a violation. Only non-empty CONTENT on one of these
#: sub-fields means the brief was mis-routed from a family/signature scope, and that is what
#: raises -- see `_assert_no_anchor`'s own docstring for why a literal "carries the anchor KEY"
#: reading would raise on every real general-scope brief that exists today.
_ANCHOR_CONTENT_KEYS: "tuple[str, ...]" = ("family", "element", "rarity", "themeKey", "motifs", "antiMotifs")

#: Group C, spec-distribution-planner.md SS2's own brief envelope -- the planner-owned mechanical
#: slot (spec-general-propose.md SS2 "What the brief inlines"). Checked for KEY presence only
#: (never a non-null value) -- `kind`/`areaShape` are legitimately `null` on real briefs today
#: (`distribution_planner/derive.py:596`, its own documented wiring gap), and a value being a
#: legal `null` is a different thing from the key being absent.
_REQUIRED_SLOT_FIELDS: "tuple[str, ...]" = ("category", "targetMode", "areaShape", "relation", "kind", "rungBand")

#: A-S1's own three scope windows (spec-distribution-planner.md SS3 step 4): general [1,4],
#: family [1,7], signature [1,10]. Rendered as PLAIN LABELS, never the raw pair the model could
#: copy into its own answer as though it were a real magnitude (spec SS2 "What the brief
#: inlines"). A-P1 only ever sees [1,4] in real production data (it reads general-scope briefs

# Worked-example probe (SMOKE BATCH criterion-2, 2026-09-05). The family-glossary fix above
# closed "a bare id carries zero semantic signal" and materially cut the unresolved rate (60.0% ->
# 40.0% on this exact scope, 2026-09-05 measurement) but did not close it -- the residual gap is a
# modest local model not reliably converging across 3 independent samples even with full semantic
# grounding per family. That fix's own report named one specific, untried next step: a single
# fully-resolved brief->answer pair in the prompt, so the model sees the expected shape once
# instead of only reading field descriptions. This section is that probe, and nothing more --
# schema and vote mechanism are unchanged (binding constraint: this is prompt CONTENT only).
#
# The pair is READ, never transcribed into a literal -- this repo's own `vocab.py` states the
# identical discipline ("a registry fact is read, never re-typed") and it applies just as much to
# a real historical example as to a live vocabulary: hand-copying a 96-id pool and a multi-field
# answer into a Python literal is exactly the kind of silent-drift risk that discipline exists to
# avoid. Both files are already real, committed, unmodified content (`git status` on this session's
# own working tree shows neither with a pending change) -- pinned by id, not by round number alone,
