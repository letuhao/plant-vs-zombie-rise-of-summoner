"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.dedup_select.similarity — tier 3's shipped heuristic
(spec-dedup-select.md §1, "⛔ DECIDED 2026-09-03"): an in-repo token-overlap Jaccard similarity,
never an embedding index or a model call. This is the ONE default implementation of the
`similarity(a, b) -> int` seam `derive.run_tier3` accepts; a real embedding index, if ever
configured, would be a second implementation of the same seam, swapped in as a constructor
argument -- nothing in `derive.py` would need to change.

**Tokenisation, per spec §1 verbatim**: lowercase, split Latin (ASCII alphanumeric) runs on
non-alphanumerics, split CJK (or any other non-ASCII alphanumeric script) PER CHARACTER. The corpus
is bilingual and motifs are CJK (e.g. `铁头功`) -- a whitespace split would make a whole CJK phrase
one token and every pair of CJK phrases distance 1 apart regardless of actual overlap.

**Similarity, per spec §1 verbatim**: `similarityMilli = 1000 * |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|` -- Jaccard over
the token SET (not bag/multiset: a repeated token contributes no extra weight, matching the plain
set-membership reading of "token bag" the formula itself implies), one integer division, per-mille,
no float anywhere (CLAUDE.md's numeric rule).

**Provenance**: with no embedding model configured, spec §3 step 5 / acceptance #7 require the
similarity FUNCTION's own id and version instead of a model id -- `SIMILARITY_FUNCTION_ID`/
`_VERSION` below are that constant.
