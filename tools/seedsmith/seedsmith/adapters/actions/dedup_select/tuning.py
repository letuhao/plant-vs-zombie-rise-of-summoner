"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.dedup_select.tuning — loads and strictly validates
`data/tuning/action-dedup.v1.json` (spec-dedup-select.md §2's "new" Reads row). A-S3 is this
file's real owner: A-S1 (`distribution_planner/tuning.py`'s `load_dedup_k`) already reads the same
file for its own narrow `k`-only need and keeps its own documented fallback default for a checkout
where this file is absent -- that loader is untouched here. This module owns the FULL shape: `k`,
`similarityThresholdMilli` (the tier-3 review-queue trigger), and `t2FieldDistance` (the tier-2
near-duplicate rule).

Refuses at LOAD time, naming the offending row -- same discipline as `distribution_planner/
tuning.py` and `type_weights/tuning.py`: a `float`, a JSON `bool` masquerading as an `int`
(Python's `bool` is an `int` subclass, checked explicitly), a numeric STRING, or an
out-of-range/unimplemented value.

#: hashing every N-of-7 masked projection instead of every 1-of-7 one, a different algorithm, not a
