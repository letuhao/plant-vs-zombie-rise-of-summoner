"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.distribution_planner.fingerprint — the rendering and distance
functions §3 step 8 needs, built to A-S3's own definition (`spec-dedup-select.md` §2), quoted
rather than re-derived: **one** definition, never a second one shaped like it.

The fingerprint has seven components, in this fixed order:
`sorted(atomFamilies) | category | targetMode | areaShape | relation | sorted(structureAxes) |
pairingRole`. The two list-valued components render as their members joined by `+` (matching the
brief JSON example's own rendering, `"burn+spread"` / `"condition+riderStatus"`); the seven
components then join with `|`. **Field distance is a Hamming distance over the seven RENDERED
strings** -- a one-member difference inside `atomFamilies` is a distance of 1 (the two rendered
strings differ), never a set-difference count. Ties break on action id (ordinal, lexicographic --
the brief/action id's own zero-padded ordinal suffix sorts correctly as a plain string).
