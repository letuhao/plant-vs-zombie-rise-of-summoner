"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.distribution_planner.derive — spec-distribution-planner.md §3's nine
steps (+2b, +4a). Pure derivation; the one file that touches disk is the sibling entrypoint
`../generate_distribution_planner.py`, matching every `derive.py` in this adapter family.

**Two genuine, undocumented gaps this module had to close, flagged rather than hidden** (same
discipline `characteristic_pool/derive.py`'s own `SIGNAL_CATEGORY` docstring uses for its own
closest analogue): the spec's nine algorithm steps never assign `slot.relation` or `slot.kind`,
yet the brief JSON example (§2) shows both and `relation` is REQUIRED on the eventual action-seed
(`kinds.py`'s `ACTION_SEED_REQUIRED`). No weight vector for either exists anywhere in the corpus
(`type-weights.json` carries no relation or kind row). Resolved:

- **`relation` gets a small structural map, `CATEGORY_RELATION`** — the same shape as
  `characteristic_pool.derive.SIGNAL_CATEGORY` (a closed, editorial, non-magnitude mapping, never
  a citation): `attack`/`status` act on an opponent (`enemy`); `support` customarily reaches
  teammates (`ally`); `defense`/`movement` customarily reach the caster (`self`). Flagged in this
  module's build report as the single most owner-review-worthy call it makes, same as
  `SIGNAL_CATEGORY` was for its own module.
- **`slot.kind` is never invented.** `kindHint` is OPTIONAL on the real action-seed schema (not
  in `ACTION_SEED_REQUIRED`), and no step of this module's own algorithm derives it — so every
  brief emits `slot.kind: null`, honest and explicit, the same "absent is a defect, empty/null is
  a value" discipline `spec-family-propose.md`'s `familyActions` and this module's own
  `familyMotifs` already use. A downstream module (A-P1/A-P2, or the model itself) decides it.

    Spec §3 leaves the JOINT distribution of two independently-allocated vectors (category counts,
    target-mode counts) over one subject's ordinals unspecified; this is a total function that turns
    two exact marginals into per-ordinal assignments without inventing a correlation — acceptance
    #3/#4b test each marginal's exactness, not a joint one, and this preserves every marginal exactly
    (only ORDER changes, never the counts).

    ⛔ **FIXED 2026-09-11 from a measured defect, not a preference.** The original body emitted each
    key's runs back-to-back (`[k]*counts[k]` in `order`), so a subject's ordinals were blocked by
    category. Zipping two blocked sequences made the JOINT frame constant for long stretches: measured
    over the live general tier (1,000 briefs), only **15 distinct frames** existed with runs up to
    **134 consecutive identical briefs**, and the first 40 briefs shared **one** frame. A proposal
    batch draws a contiguous slice of ordinals, so every batch saw near-identical context, the model
    produced near-duplicates, and A-S3 rejected **32 of 57 candidates (56%)** at tier 2. This was
    latent at the old `generalCount: 25` (runs of ~5) and the 1000-brief general tier exposed it.

    The spread is the standard stride/round-robin: key `k`'s j-th unit is placed in round `j`, with

    """**The generalized scope-level two-level allocation, over ANY closed axis.** Used for
    `category`, `targetMode`, and (via the area sub-allocation) `areaShape`.

    Two levels, and the reason each exists:

    1. **Scope quota** — `largest_remainder_apportion` over the SUM of every subject's per-mille
       vector for this axis. This is exact, and it is what A-S5's cell/`quotaDrift` metrics gate on:
       the aggregate is where a balance pass's weights actually show (attack 21.6% vs movement 18.8%
       on the live roster), so it must be reproduced, not approximated.

    2. **Per-subject assignment** — a deterministic deficit-greedy fill. Subjects are visited in the
       caller's canonical order; each of a subject's `count` slots takes the axis member with the
       most remaining scope quota, tie-broken by the subject's OWN per-mille weight for that member
       and then declared order. Every slot therefore reduces total unmet quota by one, so after
       `count * n` slots every column hits its quota exactly and every row sums to `count`.

    **Why deficit-greedy replaced the earlier largest-remainder-start + swap-repair.** Both preserve
    the column quota, but the swap version started from each subject's own largest-remainder split,
    which at `count == 5` is `1/1/1/1/1` for a near-uniform axis and — worse — concentrates: measured
    on `targetMode` it gave a single subject all five `area` slots while 903 got none. The
    deficit-greedy fill spreads each subject across the axis (it keeps taking the globally-most-
    needed member), so near-uniform axes produce near-uniform PER-SUBJECT vectors instead of
    arbitrary clumps. On a genuinely skewed axis it still follows the subject's own lean through the
    second tie-break: measured on `category`, 94% of species get exactly their own top-`count`
    categories.

    **The failure it fixes, measured 2026-09-11/12.** The original per-subject method was inert at
    `count == 5`: a member needs weight >= 400 per-mille to win a second slot (`floor(400*5/1000) == 2`),
    while the shipped `base=1000, step=250` tops out at 267 per-mille. On `category` that made all
    1,131 subjects produce the identical `1/1/1/1/1` and threw the aggregate away; on `targetMode`,
    which has **six** members, the lowest-weight one (`area`) got 0 slots for **every** subject — so
    `targetMode: area` and all four `areaShape` values were **unreachable at family and species scope**
    (0 of 6,655 briefs), a whole designed dimension silently absent. Deficit-greedy makes `area`
    reachable (750 species-slots / 188 family-slots over one full round) while keeping the exact quota.

    `rows` is `(subjectKey, milliVector)` in the caller's canonical subject order — the allocation is
    a total function of that order and the weights, never of dict iteration order. Ties use the
    declared `order`, so the result is stable and reproducible."""

    over `areaShapeMilli` (shipped uniform, `250` each), at a subject's own `area` slot count.

    **Measured defect 2026-09-12.** At family/species scope the per-subject `area` count is 0 or 1, so

    """T2.2's shortfall-only plan. One `plan_subject` call per subject NAMED in `top_up`, its count
    equal to that subject's named shortfall (`sum(want.values())`), its category counts equal to the
    `want` map itself — so a top-up round plans exactly what round n reported missing and nothing
    else.

    Subject order is the caller's `top_up` iteration order, normalised to a total order (species in
    seed order is not required here because the set is usually tiny and the subject keys are unique);
    we sort by `(scope rank, scope_key)` so the result is a pure function of the mapping's CONTENT,
    never of its insertion order.

    An unknown subject, an unknown category, or a non-positive want is refused by name — a top-up
    report that names something this planner cannot plan means the report is stale or from a
    different roster, and silently dropping it would under-plan without saying so.

    The `targetMode`/`areaShape` sub-vectors are split within the shortfall by the subject's own
    weights (`largest_remainder_count`, correct at any count) rather than the scope-level allocator:
    a top-up round has no scope-wide aggregate to apportion, and a shortfall is typically 1-3 units,
    where the per-subject split is exact and total. Each brief is an ordinary brief (`plan_subject`),

    **§3 step 8's `avoidNeighbours` is threaded here, not silently defaulted.** `plan_subject`

    `action-dedup.v1.json` via `load_dedup_k` (default 8).

    **`top_up` is the `S5 → S1` edge (T2.2, 2026-09-12).** When supplied, it REPLACES the base
    per-subject plan with exactly the shortfall it names: `{(scope, scopeKeyOrNone): {category:
    want}}` from round n's report. A top-up round plans only what is still missing — round n's
    accepted rows already persist in the committed corpus and already count against the quota, so
    re-planning the base would regenerate rows that were already accepted. A subject absent from
    `top_up` is covered and gets nothing. `None` (the round-1 default) plans the full base exactly as
