"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.validate_heal.schemas — the three pipeline draft schemas A-S4
audits and gates (spec-validate-heal.md SS2 Stage 0/1, binding constraint 2: "P-general, P-family,
P-signature... never one generic path with a `scope` switch").

**Real schemas, swapped in 2026-09-04** after the first real smoke batch proved the previous three
constants here were FIXTURES that never matched what A-P1/A-P2/A-P3 (`general_propose`,
`family_propose`, `signature_propose`) actually produce. Measured directly against real accepted
rows (`data/seed/actions/_candidates/{general,family}/round-1.json`, e.g. "Brace"/"Kinetic
Repulsion"/"Fickle Decay"/"Undead Volley") and each pipeline's own `prompts.py::entry_for`:

- **`flavor` was missing entirely** from every field set below, even though it is REQUIRED on all
  three real pipelines' own schemas (`general_propose/prompts.py::GENERAL_ACTION_SCHEMA`, etc.) and
  present on every real accepted draft. Added here, required on all three.
- **`structureAxes` was required everywhere**, but no real pipeline's own schema has ever asked the
  model for it — `structureAxes` is a rung-table-derived CEILING BUDGET the brief carries
  (`brief.slot.structureAxes`), never something A-P1/A-P2/A-P3 ask the model to answer. Downgraded
  to an allowed-but-optional property here (never required) — g2's own reaction/restriction checks
  (`gates.py`) still exercise it when a caller supplies it (e.g. a future pipeline that does ask),
  and its total absence from a real draft is correctly a no-op, never a defect.
- **`motifsExpressed` is real for A-P2/A-P3 only** (`family_propose`/`signature_propose`'s own
  schemas), never A-P1 (`general_propose` has no such field — no anchor, no motif to express).
  Required on `FAMILY_SCHEMA`/`SIGNATURE_SCHEMA`, never on `GENERAL_SCHEMA`'s own required list.
- **`differentiator` stays A-P3-only**, matching A-P3's own schema note
  (spec-signature-propose.md:160-162, quoted at spec-validate-heal.md SS2 Stage 1).

**What this schema validates is the ANSWER portion only** — `name`/`flavor`/`atomFamilies`/
`rationale`/`motifsExpressed`/`differentiator` — never the wrapper fields a real round file also
carries alongside a draft (`candidateId`/`briefId`/`scope`/`_provenance`, added by each pipeline's
own `entry_for` AFTER the model answers, or read straight off the round-row envelope). A caller
gating a real, on-disk candidate (`candidate_assembly.derive`, this program's newest module) strips
those wrapper keys before calling into `gates.run_g1`/`run_g2` — this file's own schema shape stays
the "one judgement" contract A-S4 was always meant to check, not a second copy of the envelope shape
`kinds.py`/`dedup_select` already own. `BLOCKED_FIELD`/`reason` stay declared below as a
boolean+`reason` pair for `audit_schema`'s own structural completeness check (every schema this
module owns must audit-pass) — `gates.run_g1` already exempts both names from its "extra key"
check unconditionally, regardless of a real pipeline's own different `blocked` convention (a bare
empty-string sentinel, `general_propose/prompts.py`'s own documented shape), so the two conventions
never conflict.

Three DISTINCT dict objects, on purpose, even though P-general and P-family end up structurally
close below (binding constraint 2, and SS3's own "never share one generic gate path across the
three pipelines" -- a coincidence of shape is not permission to alias the schema, since a future
P-general-only field must never silently also apply to P-family).
