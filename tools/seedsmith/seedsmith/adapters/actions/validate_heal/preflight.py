"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.validate_heal.preflight --- `--preflight` (spec-validate-heal.md SS6
hazard 4, acceptance #9c). Stage 0's second half: the schema audit proves the schema FORBIDS a
number; this proves the server is READING the schema at all. One real call, one probe schema with a
single-member enum. Modelled closely on `adapters/demons/preflight.py`'s own
`check_5_and_6_model` (the only other constrained-decoding preflight in this codebase) but scoped
down to the one check this module owns --- no dump/venv/disk checks, those are the demon-seed
program's own.

**This is the one item in this module that needs something outside the repo** (a live model
server) --- it blocks no module's build, only a real generation round (SS6 hazard 4's own words).
Every test in this module's own suite exercises this against the raising stub / under `--dry-run`
and asserts the SKIP, never the call, because tests never call a model (binding constraint 8).
