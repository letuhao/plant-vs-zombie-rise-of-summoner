"""seedsmith.adapters.actions.validate_heal.derive --- Stages 2/3 (vote, bounded self-heal) plus
the round orchestration that ties Stage 0's schema audit, Stage 1's gates (`gates.py`), Stage 2's
vote resolution and Stage 3's heal together into one per-candidate verdict and one per-round report
(spec-validate-heal.md SS2). Pure derivation except `run_self_heal`, the one function in this whole
module that makes a model call --- every other function here, including `validate_candidate` and
`validate_round`, is zero-model-call and is what `--dry-run` (acceptance #9) exercises.

**Two independent entry points, converging on the same `CandidateVerdict` shape** (deliberate, see
this module's own build report for the full reasoning): `run_self_heal` is the LIVE path --- one
brief in, a model called up to three times, a gated-or-`unresolved` draft out. `validate_candidate`
is the RECORDED path --- a draft (already healed, or hand-planted for a test) gated against g1/g2/g3
plus already-supplied vote samples, zero calls. A real run composes them (heal, then hand the
result to `validate_candidate`); every test in spec SS4 that is not specifically about the heal
loop's own call count uses `validate_candidate` directly, against the raising stub, per SS4's own
"tests never call a model" rule.

**Why `escalated` means what it means here, not what `PipelineResult`/`run_pipeline` mean by it.**
The generic `pipeline.run.run_pipeline` (Wave 3) already uses `escalated` for "heal budget
exhausted, defect still present" --- but F9 (spec SS2 Stage 3) explicitly REASSIGNS that exact
outcome to `unresolved` for a GENERATION stage, because `run_pipeline`'s own `default_for` would
hand back a brief field as though the model had answered it, which this module refuses to do. So
this module's own `escalated` is reserved for something `run_pipeline` has no name for: a genuinely
unexpected exception during one candidate's processing (a permutation-reproduction mismatch --- SS2
Stage 2's F8-corrected replacement raises rather than returning a soft verdict --- or any other bug
this module has no named path for), caught at the ROUND level and reported rather than aborting the
whole round. This is the SAME convention `workflow/runner.py`'s own `run_many` already uses for a
fan-out subject that raised (`"outcome": "escalated"`, `runner.py:66`) --- reused deliberately,
not reinvented, and given a real reason here because it is easy to misread as sharing
`run_pipeline`'s meaning when it does not.
