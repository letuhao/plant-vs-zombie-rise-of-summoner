"""seedsmith.budget.derive — `budget derive` (spec-budget.md §4).

Three methods, in preference order: stated (a document says it) > structural (arithmetic on a
committed allocation) > proportional (a known total split by a declared weight). The order
matters — the temptation is to jump straight to proportional, and a proportional row carries
wider tolerance and is marked as such precisely so nobody mistakes a reasoned default for a
decision (spec-budget.md §4.3).

Scoped to the three rows this task can derive with real, citation-checked data — not a generic
markdown-scanning SSOT walker (spec-budget.md's "walks every SSOT" is a substantially larger
document-parsing system than three example rows justify building blind; the two document
citations below were read and confirmed live, 2026-08-23, not carried over from the spec text
unverified).
