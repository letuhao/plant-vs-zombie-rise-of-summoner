"""Idempotence and provenance (spec-pipeline.md, plan G2).

Two questions this makes answerable about any generated row:

- **"Why does this row exist?"** — the finding it was generated to close.
- **"Which prompt version produced it?"** — so a bad batch is scoped by version rather than by
  eyeballing dates.

And one it makes unnecessary: **"will re-running duplicate everything?"** A pipeline checks whether
its finding is already closed *before* generating. Re-running over unchanged input writes nothing,
which is what makes the whole loop safe to run on a schedule rather than only by hand.

**The clock is injected.** A timestamp is the one field that would otherwise make provenance
non-reproducible, and a test that cannot pin it either asserts nothing about it or becomes flaky.
Same discipline as the kernel drive's injected `Stopwatch`.
