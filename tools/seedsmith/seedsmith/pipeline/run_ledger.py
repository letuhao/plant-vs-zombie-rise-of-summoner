"""seedsmith.pipeline.run_ledger — the shared resume/append/reconcile/overwrite base every
item-seedgen generator builds on (docs/architecture/item-seedgen/spec-generator-harness.md).

Generalizes `adapters.items.setgen.run`'s own proven ~1,800-entry-scale ledger (atomic write,
idempotent resume) and adds the one thing that ledger does not do: validate an existing entry's
actual shape before trusting a "done" hit, so a corpus a hand edit broke out of band gets reconciled
on the next run rather than silently skipped forever.

**Deterministic by construction.** Nothing in this module makes a model/LLM call. `write_done`
canonicalizes with `sort_keys=True` — `setgen/run.py`'s own `write_ledger` does not do this
(confirmed by reading it directly), so two runs of THAT ledger are not guaranteed byte-identical.
This module does not inherit that gap.
