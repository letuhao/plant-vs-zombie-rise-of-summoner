"""Running a pipeline: validate before accept, retry with the defect named, then escalate.

The loop itself is `llm_caller.call_with_self_heal` (S0) — **reused, not rebuilt**, exactly as the
plan requires. What this module adds is the schema-shaped verification S0's flat string-keyed
version could not express, and the scratch → gate → move discipline.

**Nothing is persisted until the gate passes.** Accepting first and validating afterwards is how a
bad batch reaches the corpus and has to be unpicked by hand; the ordering here makes that impossible
rather than unlikely.
