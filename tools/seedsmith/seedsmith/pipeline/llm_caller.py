"""seedsmith.pipeline.llm_caller — local-model transport with reasoning disabled.

Ported from `D:\\Works\\source\\lore-weave\\scripts\\i18n_translate.py`, proven in production on
that project's translate pipeline (spec-pipeline.md §5.1). Two pieces are copied close to as-is
(`call_model`, `extract_json`); the self-heal loop is generalized — `translate_chunk()`'s
translation-specific verify is replaced by a `verify_fn` parameter, so any future seedsmith
pipeline (flavour text, set headers, …) supplies its own hard/soft rule and reuses this loop
unchanged.

No import from `seedsmith.corpus`, `seedsmith.adapters`, or `seedsmith.metrics`, in either
direction. This module has no position in that dependency chain (tasks/seedsmith-plan.md, S0) —
it is buildable and testable before any of those exist, and must stay that way.

    `max_tokens` (`config.max_tokens`, default 16384) is still sent as a hard backstop for
    whatever the repetition detector's own heuristic misses, but it is no longer the FIRST line of
    defense — see `DegenerateGenerationError`'s own docstring for why a schema `maxLength` and
    `max_tokens` alone were not enough (the 2026-09-08 incident happened with both already in
    place).

    Two redundant fields are sent on every call because different servers/templates read
    different keys: `reasoning_effort` is the OpenAI-style field some servers honor directly;
    `chat_template_kwargs` is passed straight through to the model's own Jinja chat template,

    `enable_thinking`/`thinking`. Sending both is harmless — an OpenAI-compatible server or
    template ignores whichever key it doesn't recognize.

    `schema` (optional, spec-dependency-baseline.md §2.4) turns on CONSTRAINED DECODING: LM Studio
    enforces a JSON Schema's STRUCTURAL keys (`type`/`enum`/`properties`/`required`) at decode time
    via llama.cpp's GBNF grammar sampling for GGUF models, so a token that would break one of those
    is never sampleable. It does NOT enforce `pattern` or, confirmed 2026-09-08, `minLength`/
    `maxLength` — grammar-from-JSON-Schema conversion commonly skips string-length bounds because
    expressing "at most N characters" as a context-free grammar production is a much harder
    problem than a structural or enum check. `extract_json` stays as defense-in-depth regardless.

    """Call the model, verify the parsed output, and self-heal on named defects.

    Generalized from `translate_chunk()`: that function hardcoded a translation-specific
    `verify_chunk`; here `verify_fn(items, out) -> (hard, soft)` is supplied by the caller, so
    a flavour-text pipeline, a set-header pipeline, or any future one reuses this exact loop
    with its own rule.

    `hard` failures block acceptance and trigger a re-prompt naming the exact defect per key —
    a bare retry teaches the model nothing; naming the reason is what fixes it (spec-pipeline.md
    §3.6). `soft` failures are reported but never retried automatically.

    On exhausted heal rounds, `default_for(key, original_value)` supplies the no-silent-drop
    fallback (default: the original item's own value) and the returned `soft` dict records
    every such key as `"FAILED:<reason>"` — never blank, never silently dropped.

    Never raises on a model or parse failure — a dead attempt re-prompts for valid JSON and is
    caught uniformly by the next round's `verify_fn`, exactly like any other named defect.

    `schema` (optional, default `None` — every existing caller is byte-for-byte unaffected)
    passes straight through to every `call_model` attempt this loop makes, including heal
    re-prompts: `call_model`'s own constrained-decoding contract (measured 2026-09-01 against
    `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-qat`) makes a schema-violating token unsampleable, which is strictly
    stronger than a post-hoc `verify_fn` re-prompt and is why a caller with a real JSON Schema for
    its draft shape should supply one here rather than relying on the heal loop alone to talk the
    model into a required key it keeps omitting.
