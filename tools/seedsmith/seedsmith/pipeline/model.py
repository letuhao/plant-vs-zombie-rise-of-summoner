"""The `Pipeline` scaffold and its guardrails (spec-pipeline.md §2-§3, plan G1).

Six guardrails, and the load-bearing one is the third:

1. **Schema-validated locally, always.** A model's structured-output mode is an upgrade, never the
   only check — an endpoint that silently ignores the mode would otherwise remove the guard.
2. **Narrow scope per call.** One partition, one kind.
3. **⛔ Never a number.** A schema carrying a numeric magnitude field is rejected *mechanically*, by
   `audit_schema`, not by review. Numbers come from `numerics`, which resolves them from bands and
   the shipped progression — a model inventing one produces a value that looks plausible and is
   unanchored to anything, which is the hardest kind of wrong to find later.
4. **Closed vocabularies inlined** — reusing `briefkit`'s inlining rather than a second copy.
5. **Validate before accept.** Scratch → gate → move. Nothing reaches the corpus unvalidated.
6. **Bounded retry with the exact defect named, then escalate.** A bare retry teaches the model
   nothing; naming the defect is what fixes it. This is `llm_caller.call_with_self_heal` (S0)
   generalized to an arbitrary schema, **reused rather than rebuilt**.

Every schema carries a `blocked` variant: a model that cannot do the job must be able to say so with
a reason. A `blocked` response writes nothing and is **reported, not counted as a failure** — the
difference matters, because a pipeline that treats "I can't" as an error retries it forever.

    Walks `properties`, `items`, and the composition keywords, because a numeric field nested three
    levels inside an array of objects is exactly as dangerous as a top-level one and considerably
    easier to miss by eye. That is the whole argument for auditing mechanically.

    An `enum` of numbers is **allowed**: a closed set of legal values is a vocabulary, not an
    invention — the model is choosing, not deriving. This is the ORIGINAL rule and applies only to
    numbers of JSON type `number`/`integer`; it does not exempt a NAME from the three checks below.

    Three further checks, added for `validate-heal` (A-S4, spec-validate-heal.md SS2 Stage 0) and
    inherited by every seedsmith pipeline because they live HERE rather than in a program-local
    copy: a `string` property whose `pattern` admits a bare number is exactly as good a hiding place
    for a magnitude as a numeric `type`; an `enum` of numeric STRINGS (`"1"`, `"2"`) is the same
    invention wearing a string's clothes; and a property NAME drawn from the magnitude vocabulary
    (`MAGNITUDE_DENY_NAMES`, or anything ending `MAGNITUDE_DENY_SUFFIX`) is refused regardless of
    its declared type, because the name alone invites a downstream reader to treat it as a real
    magnitude — this one fires even when the value is a legal, enum-closed vocabulary, on purpose.

    `name_allowlist` is the escape hatch the spec requires for the name check ONLY: a property that
    is genuinely an identifier (never entering arithmetic) is exempted BY NAME, per call, with the
    CALLER's own comment saying why — never a blanket exemption baked in here. `field_name` is the
    last-seen property name, threaded through recursion (mirrors `adapters/demons/anchor/audit.py`'s
    `numeric_audit`) so the name-based checks see it at any nesting depth, including inside an
