"""List scheduling and the work-order document (spec-planner.md §5-§6, plan P4).

Three rules, all deliberately dumb:

- **Layer by layer**, never crossing a dependency edge — the layers come from `ordering`, so this
  module never decides what depends on what.
- **Longest-job-first within a layer** — classic list scheduling. Partitions with more entries take
  longer, and starting them first shortens the makespan.
- **Model tier by a rule table, not an optimiser.** A table is auditable; an optimiser is a second
  thing to debug when the plan looks wrong, and "why did it pick that model" is not a question
  anyone should have to answer by reading a search.

**Every job names the findings it closes.** That link is what makes a work order gradeable: after
execution the metrics re-run, and a job that ran without clearing its finding is a **pipeline**
defect rather than a content one. Without it, a failed generation is indistinguishable from content
nobody attempted.

⛔ **A spec conflict resolved here, deliberately and with evidence.** `spec-planner.md` §7 says the
planner *"must place the four base-type partitions in the base-type layer"*. The plan and todo say
the opposite — they are **excluded**, because S2 found their `_meta.partition` string is wrong while
the entries' own `role`/`frame` fields are intact. They hold real content and need a **relabel**,
not generation. The newer, evidence-backed reading wins; generating into them would author
duplicates of content that already exists. `EXCLUDED_REASON_MISLABELED` carries that decision to
anyone reading the output.
