"""seedsmith.metrics.model — Metric, Finding, Loop, Severity, Ctx (spec-metrics.md §1-2).

Four fields on `Metric` carry rules rather than data (spec-metrics.md §1):

- `loop`: a CLOSED metric can verify its own fix; an OPEN one cannot and so may never gate —
  enforced here, not by convention, because "Loop.OPEN with gates=True raises" is itself an
  acceptance criterion (tasks/seedsmith-todo.md, S1).
- `gates`: starts False for every new metric; promotion is a deliberate, later, separate act
  (spec-metrics.md §4).
- `needs`: declared so the runner can skip cleanly — a metric needing `budget` when none exists
  reports NOT_MEASURED, never a pass; silence and success must stay distinguishable.
- `covers`: which Appendix-A defect ids this metric claims (spec-metrics.md §5) — not enforced
  structurally in S1 (there is no Appendix-A binding yet for the stub feature), but the field
  exists from the start so no later module has to retrofit it onto every existing metric.
