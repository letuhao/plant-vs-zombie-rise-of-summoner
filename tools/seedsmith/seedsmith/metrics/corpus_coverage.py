"""seedsmith.metrics.corpus_coverage — CorpusCoverage/DumpCompleteness,
CorpusCoverage/BasisHistogram (spec-corpus-dump.md, spec-power-parse.md; demon-seed `seed-to-
concrete` T1.10).

Both metrics need `ctx.demon_dump` (a `DemonDumpCtx`, T1.10's own loader) rather than
`ctx.corpus`/`ctx.adapter` — the demon dump is a pre-corpus artifact (JSON captured straight from
the DAL, not seedsmith content entries), so it gets its own `Ctx` slot rather than being forced
through the generic `Corpus.load()` shape it was never structured to fit.

**Every target here is declared in tuning, never a literal in this file (P2).** A metric without a
target is an opinion; `data/tuning/demon-corpus-targets.v1.json` is the balance surface these two
metrics read from.
