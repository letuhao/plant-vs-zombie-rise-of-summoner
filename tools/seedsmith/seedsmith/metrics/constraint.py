"""seedsmith.metrics.constraint — Constraint (spec-metrics.md §3; S7, tasks/seedsmith-todo.md).

Not a re-implementation of any individual rule — it owns the *class*: a rule stated in a lane
document with no corresponding check in either tool. Expressed as a manifest of
rule -> check bindings; a documented rule with no binding anywhere is the finding.

The manifest below is real, not illustrative: eight rule codes verified live against
`tools/ItemSeedValidator/Checks/UniqueRuleCheck.cs`/`SetRuleCheck.cs`
(`grep -n "AddFinding|const string" ...`), plus two verified against
`seedsmith.metrics.linkage`. Building this manifest is what caught spec-metrics.md's own wrong
claim that all five historically-prose-only rules "now ship as C#" — the hybrid-core requirement
ships only in `seedsmith`, not C#, and the spec text said otherwise until this task corrected it
(see spec-metrics.md's own correction note, dated the same day).
