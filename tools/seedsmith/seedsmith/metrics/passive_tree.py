"""seedsmith.metrics.passive_tree — `PassiveTree/TreeEqualValue` (spec-tree-plan.md §3.2, task C1)
plus the eight `PassiveTree/*` corpus metrics (spec-tree-language.md §7 gates 15-22, task H4), plus
task H5's own three `tree-review` metrics (spec-tree-review.md §4.1, §4.2, §7): the CONTENT-side
half of `TreeEqualValue` (over `tree-binder`'s own bound prices, folded into the SAME registration
C1 already made — never a second metric sharing one name), `PassiveTree/DeepMechanismValue`
(`gates=False`, reports rather than blocks), and `PassiveTree/HiddenFileCount` (walks every seed
root WITHOUT the `_`-prefix skip convention, reporting `visitedFileCount` explicitly).

`spec-tree-review.md:202` leans on this gate to justify not sampling budgets by hand, and
`:210` correctly notes it is plan-side arithmetic rather than one of `tree-language`'s 24
content gates. It was left unowned by both specs; this module is where it lives, registered
beside `Distribution/CellOccupancy` (`metrics/cell_occupancy.py`) and the `action.corpus.*`
family (`metrics/action_coverage.py`) through the SAME `Metric`/`MetricRegistry` machinery.

The real arithmetic is `adapters.trees.plan.invariants.check_tree_equal_value` — this module is a
thin `Metric` wrapper, the same shape `action_coverage.py`'s own docstring describes for itself:
"the real computation lives in the adapter; this is a thin wrapper." It never raises out of
`run()` (the `Metric` contract here is "return findings," not "throw") — a violation becomes a
GAP-severity `Finding` naming the tree/branch/tier/archetype the underlying refusal named, so a
caller that wants a hard stop still has `invariants.check_tree_equal_value` itself, which DOES
raise, and IS what `report/cli.py`'s `--emit`/`--check` paths call directly.

⛔ **H4's own honest finding, stated once here rather than repeated in every class below.** The
node record `tree-language` actually persists (`nodegen/emit.py:NodeSeedRecord.to_dict`) carries
`nodeClass`, `exclusion.{form,propertyKeys,printedText}`, `name`, `nameKey`, `flavor`, `affixIds`
and `affinity` — it does NOT carry `trigger`, `element`, `status` or `channelFamily` (§5.1's own
"blocked on other work" finding: the atom-tag registry that would let a node's own bound affixes
be traced back to those four axes does not exist yet). So a metric that needs one of those four
axes (`QuotaDrift`, `CellOccupancy`) reads it off `PassiveTreePlanCtx.quota_cells_by_tree` — the
per-node `QuotaCell` H3's own `quota.assign_quota_cells` computed AT GENERATION TIME, which is the
only place today those four axes are recorded at all. This is a wiring gap (CLAUDE.md's own
rule, not an architectural wall): the day a generation run persists `quotaCell` onto the node
record itself, this ctx field is filled from the committed corpus directly rather than a
caller-supplied snapshot, and no metric below needs to change.

    so an unresolved species was silently generated with ZERO stats. The same shape holds here: an
    `affixIds` vote that never resolves (`nodegen/run.py`'s `generate_node`, `vote.confidence ==
    "unresolved"`) produces a `NodeOutcome` with no `record` at all — the node is silently ABSENT
    from `data/seed/passive-tree/nodes/<treeId>.json` rather than present with a broken effect,
    which `tree-binder` has nothing to price and the tree ends up with a hole nobody flagged.
    Gating the RATE stops a run early — before the remaining thousands of calls — the moment a node
    class's brief has become systematically too ambiguous for its one voted field to converge,
    rather than discovering the hole tree-by-tree after the corpus is already spent.

    Every other `PassiveTree/*` metric starts `gates=False` and stays there until a deliberate,
    later, separate promotion (`metrics/model.py`'s own rule) — this is the one gate §7.1 promotes
    up front, and `assert_exactly_one_hard_gate(registry, "PassiveTree")` is what proves it is the
    ONLY one once every metric in this file is registered together.

    **J5 addition (spec-species-tree.md §3.1/§4):** a species the not-yet-built favour-lock stage
    could not resolve to any of its three offered cells is the SAME shape of hole — silently absent
    from a decision that must be made, not merely absent from prose — so it gates under this SAME
    class as a second, independent `subject="mechanicalFavour"` population (`species_favour_
    outcomes`), rather than a second `gates=True` class, which `assert_exactly_one_hard_gate` would
    refuse. Reported only when a caller actually supplies it; every pre-J5 site is unaffected.

    """spec-tree-review.md §4.2 / §6.4's settled ruling (2026-09-05): the deep-tier behavioural
    sample REPORTS; it never gates. `MechanismRampMetric` above checks the plan's own LABEL
    (`nodeClass == "mechanism"` at the tier the archetype ramp names); this metric is the other
    half §4.2 names — does a mechanism node that deep actually DO anything, proxied by a
    `CombatSim` win-share delta over a sample. `tools/CombatSim` is a C# tool this Python-side
    metric cannot run itself (a wiring gap in CLAUDE.md's precise sense, not this task's own scope
    — stated here rather than papered over): this metric reads whatever samples a real sweep
    already produced (`deep_mechanism_samples`) and never derives a number from the plan or the
    corpus on its own, the same "compose real results, invent nothing" discipline every other
    CLOSED metric in this family already holds to.

    `gates = False` is not a threshold this metric merely happens to clear today — §4.2 states the
    reason once and this class exists to hold it structurally: "the score is a proxy for a proxy...
    and this module does not let an instrument that thin deny a lot a pass." A systemic
    below-threshold result still surfaces here as a GAP finding — it is not toothless, per §4.2's
    own "a systemic result... is a rung-3 or rung-4 trigger" — but `targets.GATING_METRICS` never
    names this metric id, and `RunReport.verdict` (`nodegen/verdict.py`) only ever consults a
    metric's outcome when it is in that dict or is `PassiveTree/UnresolvedCount` by name; a metric
    absent from both structurally cannot flip a run's PASS/FAIL regardless of its own findings'

class SpeciesUniquenessMetric(Metric):
    """spec-species-tree.md §5 — three uniqueness strengths, ONE reverse index built over every
    committed tree's own nodes, walked once per run:

    - **U1** text uniqueness — a `(name, flavor)` pair appearing on more than one node, corpus-wide.
      Generation-time `name_collision`/the shipped dedup (`metrics/dedup.py`) already catch this
      INCREMENTALLY as each tree generates against `takenNames`; this is the closed-corpus,
      all-trees-committed re-verification a review pass runs once, not a duplicate of that check —
      the two run at different times over different populations (one tree growing vs. the whole
      corpus at rest) and either can catch what the other's timing misses.
    - **U2** composition uniqueness — a `(affixIds multiset, quotaCell)` fingerprint appearing in
      more than one TREE. Needs `quota_cells_by_tree` alongside `nodes_by_tree`, since a node's own
      committed seed record does not persist its `quotaCell` (H4's own documented wiring gap, still
      open — a tree with no supplied quota cells simply contributes nothing to this half of the
      index, never a crash).
    - **U3** namespace uniqueness — any `affix.species.<speciesId>.*` id referenced by a node whose
      OWN tree is not `speciesId` (a species tree's `tree_id` IS its `speciesId`, matching every
      other tree category's own tree_id-is-the-roster-id convention). The one strength that
      actually costs (§5.2) — 6,720 authored affixes at `speciesUniqueAffixMin=8` (D41) — so this
      is the one worth a corpus-wide leak check, not just a per-tree glance.

    `gates = False`: §5.1's own shipped posture — *"gates on none of them until the pilot calibrates
    the thresholds... promote one gate at a time, only after a real run has been measured"* — the
    identical reasoning `FavourDriftMetric`/`DeepMechanismValueMetric` above already carry. Never a
    second `gates=True` class; `assert_exactly_one_hard_gate` would refuse it.
