"""seedsmith.metrics.pipeline_health — the classification RUN's own health (demon-seed module 7,
`seed-to-concrete` T2.12). Distinct from `roster-metrics` (T2.10, which measures the RESULTING
distribution): this measures how the PIPELINES themselves behaved — how often they disagreed with
themselves, how often they needed a repair, whether the echoed `basis` still matches what
`power-parse` actually computed.

**The `threat-audit` disagreement queue (`review_queue.py`, T2.5) is OPEN-loop and is never
registered here as a metric** — it is a review queue by design (Q16: "number wins, and the LLM
audits the result"), and a metric that could gate on it would silently reintroduce exactly the
override the design forbids. `test_threat_audit_queue_never_gates` pins this structurally.
