"""seedsmith.metrics.motif_sharing — Distribution/MotifSharing (spec-demon-metrics.md §2.2, A2).

Field-naming contract this metric reads from a "demon" entry, once `motif-derive` (D2.3) is wired
to write its output onto the corpus (not yet built — this metric works today against a corpus that
carries none of these fields, and correctly reports "nothing to measure"):

  entry.data["motifs"]              -> list[str], as `DerivedMotifs.motifs`
  entry.data["motifTautological"]   -> bool, as `DerivedMotifs.tautological` (A2's own flag,
                                        READ here, never re-derived — motif-derive already computed
                                        it, and re-deriving the same fact in a second module is
                                        exactly the drift this repo's own discipline warns against)

`loop = OPEN`: whether a sharing level is GOOD has no machine answer (a tightly-themed roster and
an under-differentiated one produce similar numbers), so every finding here is `Severity.NOTE` —
never `GAP` — and carries no pass/fail field. Asserting one would be the "mark its own homework"
defect `audit_open_loop_schema` refuses for a pipeline schema; the same discipline applies to a
metric's own verdict, even though `audit_open_loop_schema` itself only walks JSON schemas and has
nothing to check here directly.
