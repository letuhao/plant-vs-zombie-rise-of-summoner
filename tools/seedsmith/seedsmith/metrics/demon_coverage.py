"""seedsmith.metrics.demon_coverage — Coverage/DemonUncovered (spec-demon-metrics.md §2.1, A5).

Lives in `metrics/`, not `adapters/demons/`, on purpose (spec §4): per-entity coverage is a generic
property — items will want it too — and the adapter supplies the strata (which entries exist, how
they reference each other via `reference_fields`), the metric does the counting. This is the same
split `provenance-supersede` was moved to core backlog to preserve.

**Fully generic, no demon-specific hardcoding beyond the default `subject_kind`.** Coverage is
computed by scanning every OTHER kind's entries for ANY field value equal to a subject's id — the
same "does this string look like a reference" question `Corpus.discover_edges` already answers,
applied per-subject instead of corpus-wide. A subject with zero referencing entries anywhere is
`GAP`-uncovered (audit A5's own fix: family coverage is a different, and insufficient, question —
"a handful of multi-family demons can satisfy every partition while most of the roster gets no
content, and coverage reports green"). A subject with ANY referencing entry is fully covered and produces NO finding at all — silence is
healthy, the same convention `Coverage/EmptyPartition` already uses (owner, 2026-08-31: "any
generated artifact counts"; the stricter "every eligible kind must be present" reading was
explicitly rejected as noise on a small roster). "Report per-kind breakdown" (the other half of
that decision) lives inside the ONE finding a zero-content subject produces: its evidence names
every kind that was checked and found absent, which is the actionable detail a bare "uncovered"
would not give a reader deciding what to generate next.
