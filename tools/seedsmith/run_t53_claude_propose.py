"""T5.3's own real authoring run, performed directly by Claude's own reasoning rather than a local
LM Studio model (which this environment cannot reach) — same substitution pattern already used for
`run_checkpoint8a_claude_propose.py` (fusion recipes) and `run_t71_claude_propose.py` (affixes).

A small, deliberate batch (3 species) over REAL committed anchors and the REAL 10-affix catalog,
picked for thematic coherence against each species' own real aptitude/posture/element/traits (read
from `data/seed/creatures/species/**/*.json`, not guessed) and each affix's own real effect. Submitted
as 3 unanimous "samples" per species through the REAL, unmodified `entry_for`/`fixed_core_within_band`
— an honest single judgment call, not a fabricated stochastic spread (same framing the two precedents
above already use).

**Deliberately conservative, not exhaustive**: every pick respects `creature-species-effects.v1.json`'s
own `fixedCoreBandByRarity` for that species' real rarity (`conezombie` is `chaff` — band {0,0} — so
it gets ZERO core picks, pool only) and avoids the two still-unbuilt validator paths this run cannot
exercise correctly (posture/resource conflict-repair) by simply not authoring a pick that would
trigger one — a real, working small batch, not a stress test of gaps this task's own evidence already
named and left open.
