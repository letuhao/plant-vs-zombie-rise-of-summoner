"""T7.1/T7.2's own real authoring run, performed directly by Claude's own reasoning rather than a
local LM Studio model (which this environment cannot reach) — matching the same, already-established
substitution `run_checkpoint8a_claude_propose.py` used for the fusion-recipe gap-fill. Each draw below
is a genuinely reasoned named bundle over the REAL eligible atom pool (`generate_affixes.py`'s own
`load_eligible_atoms`, read fresh here, not copied), fed through the REAL, unmodified
`run_voted_draws` (schema validation, per-member vote via `resolve_set_vote`, class derivation,
persistence) exactly as three permuted samples from a real model would be — except every sample for a
given draw is the SAME considered choice, submitted honestly as a single judgment call, not a
fabricated multi-sample spread pretending to be independent stochastic noise it does not have (same
framing `run_checkpoint8a_claude_propose.py` already uses for the fusion-recipe run).

Small, deliberate batch — matching the owner's own explicitly-stated preference for small batches
reviewed before scaling (spec-affix-authoring.md's own precedent, `seed-to-concrete-phased-rollout-
decision`), not a bid to fill the whole eligible pool in one pass.
