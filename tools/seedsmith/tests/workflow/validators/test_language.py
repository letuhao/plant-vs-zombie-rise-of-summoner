"""Task 4b (seedsmith-content-standard) — the bidirectional `language_consistency` fix.

No dedicated regression test existed for this validator before this task (confirmed: grep found
zero test files importing it) — both directions below are new coverage, not merely an extension of
an existing suite. The reverse-direction fixture is the REAL, already-shipped dungeon defect's own
