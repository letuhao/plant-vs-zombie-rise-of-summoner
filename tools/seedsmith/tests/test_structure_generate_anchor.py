"""Tests for `seedsmith.adapters.structures.generate_anchor` (spec-structure-pipeline.md, base-defense
module 28). **Every test in this file supplies its own stub `caller=` — none ever reaches a real
model.** `test_no_test_in_this_file_omits_the_caller_stub` proves that structurally, by source scan,
so a future test added here cannot silently start making real network calls.

The ONE real call spec 28.3 requires ("prove constrained decoding... before the batch") was made for
real, manually, against the live local LM Studio endpoint — not from pytest — and its evidence is
recorded in `tasks/base-defense-todo.md`'s own 28.3 entry, matching this program's "tests never call
a model" rule stated as literally as possible.
