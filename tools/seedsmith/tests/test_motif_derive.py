# principles while writing this note, NOT by a failing test ... a real limitation of this module's
# current coverage, not silently smoothed over."
#
# These two tests close it. The original defect: `basis` excluded a demon's OWN contribution
# whenever the demon had ANY family — so a demon whose own name-derived token genuinely survived
# into `motifs` reported `basis="text"` (inherited from the family) and hid the fact that part of
# its emitted vocabulary traces back to a bare string. `tautological` could not catch this: it
# requires EVERY family to be name-based, and here the family is text-based.

# first and fails the second. Both directions are needed to pin the actual rule.
