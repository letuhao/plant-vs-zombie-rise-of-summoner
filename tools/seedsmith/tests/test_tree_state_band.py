"""Tests for spec-tree-state.md §2.2c/§2.2d (task C11) — the archetype reward-per-skill-point band
and the wallet-clears-the-tier-it-opened band, walked at EVERY tier for ALL THREE shipped
archetypes, in exact integer ratios throughout (CLAUDE.md's overflow/precision rules — no float on a
magnitude or a comparison that gates content).

Why this file exists (spec-tree-state.md §2.2c): the OLD test,
`reward_per_skill_point_is_flat_when_first_equals_step_times_k_plus_one_over_two`
(`tools/seedsmith/tests/test_tree_plan_ladder.py`), asserts the flatness algebra for a given `k` — it
passes on a `k = 4` fixture and never reads `tree-plan`'s actual, deliberately non-uniform width
vectors. Checking only the endpoint (tier 10, where all three shipped archetypes agree by
construction — every archetype spends the same 40-node total) is precisely what let a 6.0× spread at
tier 2 survive undetected. That older test KEEPS its narrower scope — it stays evidence about the
algebra at constant width, never evidence about the shipped corpus (§2.2c's own instruction). This
file is the corpus evidence: it reads `tree-plan`'s REAL shipped width vectors
(`seedsmith.adapters.trees.plan.archetypes.SHIPPED_ARCHETYPES`) and the REAL tunables
(`data/tuning/passive-tree.v1.json` via `plan_tuning.load()`), at every tier, for every archetype.
