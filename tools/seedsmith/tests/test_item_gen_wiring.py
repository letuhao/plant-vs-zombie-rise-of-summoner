"""Tests for the `items generate --write` wiring (item module 13's deferred generation graph).

    python -m pytest tools/seedsmith/tests/test_item_gen_wiring.py -q

⭐ **What this file proves and what it deliberately does not.** It proves the PATH: a planned
subject reaches the graph, an authored answer comes back through the injected transport, the
already-built distributors price it or refuse it with their own rule names, a refusal re-prompts,
an exhausted subject escalates without taking the batch with it, and a clean batch writes a seed
file somewhere it was told to. It does not judge the CONTENT — that is what the run report's
distinctness metrics are for, and they are measured over a real batch in the module's todo entry.

⭐ **`Module13DefectsFixedTests` at the bottom is the five defects this wiring MEASURED in module
13's own machinery on 2026-09-06, now asserted in their fixed state.** They were first written as
"this is the state today", with the numbers, so that a fix could not land silently — the fix landed
the same day and the assertions were inverted rather than deleted. The before-numbers stay in the
docstrings, because a fix whose evidence has been deleted cannot be re-checked.

    `capability` field, now for a DIFFERENT reason — the model never split an elemental pick's
    `family`/`variant` the way `resolve_capability`'s object contract expects, and there is
    nowhere else in this program a model is asked to produce a family as anything but one plain
    string (`resolve_pick`'s own docstring already tolerates two SPELLINGS of a plain string;
    this is a different shape problem). Two live shapes were observed:

    1. An elemental pick's full printed id echoed into BOTH fields:
       `{"family": "atom.deathblast.fire", "variant": "atom.deathblast.fire"}` instead of the
       split `{"family": "atom.deathblast", "variant": "fire"}` the schema actually asks for.
    2. A flat (variant-less) pick given a placeholder `variant` instead of omitting it:
       `{"family": "atom.freezing", "variant": "none"}`.

    Both are legal, unambiguous picks a human reading the printed list would recognize
    instantly. `resolve_capability` now tries the untouched `family` value as a plain pick_id
    FIRST (`resolve_pick`, the same tolerant lookup every stat/charm family already goes
    through) before falling back to the family+variant combination — so a model that never

        FIFTH real bug the same run found — `authored.run_batch` starting `done = {}` fresh every

        erased the first run's entries outright (their seed files stayed on disk, untouched, but a

        58 -> 61 same day: chasing that same regenerate down turned up a SIXTH real bug —

        which read a hardcoded default ledger path completely disconnected from the one
        `--write` actually reads/writes, so every invocation replanned the FULL population
        (`"alreadyDone": 0` always) regardless of what earlier runs had already persisted. Fixed
        in `cmd_items` to read the same `<out-dir>/set-charm-gen.ledger.json` `--write` uses. That
        fixed run itself net-added 3 more subjects, and separately reproduced 'Triple-Line
