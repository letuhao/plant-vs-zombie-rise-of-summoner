///
/// <para><b>Why this exists, stated once rather than re-argued at every call site.</b> F7 found
/// <see cref="TreeModel.Resolve"/>'s fold-back (`effective += AptitudeAllocation.Single(...)`) routes
/// tree power through <see cref="AptitudeAllocation.Share"/> -- `Total(id)/GrandTotal()`, a ZERO-SUM
/// ratio across every aptitude the actor holds. Growing one tree's contribution therefore dilutes every
/// OTHER tree's own combat contribution too, an artifact the real pipeline
/// (<see cref="Core.PassiveTree.Resolve.TreeAtomSource.BoundAtomsFor"/>, which writes a flat/increased
/// modifier straight to one channel, independent of any other tree) has no analog for -- and the
/// coupling is asymmetric between concentrated and spread allocations, the exact axis

///
/// <para><b>The fix, mirroring an already-proven pattern in this same project.</b>
/// <see cref="Erosion.MeasureMechanismPair"/> already demonstrates the right shape for injecting a

/// are structurally unaffected by this class's addition.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The representative-channel approximation, stated rather than hidden.</b> This harness never
