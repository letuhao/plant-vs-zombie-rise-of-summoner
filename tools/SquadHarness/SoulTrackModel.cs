/// <see cref="TreeModel"/>'s `H` blend the SOUL track (D3, D8) so `concentration.wMilli` becomes
/// genuinely measurable across BOTH tracks -- <see cref="TreeModel.Resolve"/> always reads
/// <c>HSoulsMilli</c> as an honest zero (its own doc: "not modelled yet"); this class is what fills
/// that in, calling the REAL production <see cref="SoulTrack.ThetaNode"/> (spec-tree-resolve.md §6.2)
/// rather than re-deriving D3's formula (CLAUDE.md "no private f(level)").
///
/// <para><b>What "soul levels per tree" means here, stated as a harness default (no production
/// formula exists to derive it -- this is `tree-state`'s own wiring gap, exactly like §1.1's per-actor
/// allocation gap).</b> A soul level is spent by player action and stored per NODE
/// (<c>RpgStore.PassiveTree.cs</c> stores <c>soul_level</c>, <see cref="FusionRpg.Core.PassiveTree.State.ClassifiedTreeNode"/>)
/// -- there is no shipped function mapping Θ to a TOTAL soul-level count the way
/// <see cref="PointBudget.PointsFor"/> maps Θ to an aptitude-point budget. This class reuses that SAME
/// real production rate as the harness's own soul-level budget (one Θ, one rate, applied to a SECOND
/// track) rather than inventing a private curve. The per-tree SHAPE (spike vs. spread) is the SAME
/// share vector the point track already computed (<see cref="TreeModel.PerTreeState.AptitudePoints"/>),
/// because a squad-harness actor has exactly one investment shape, not two independent ones -- this is
/// the same "one build, one corner-shape helper" discipline §1's own doc names for the point track.</para>
///
/// <para><b>H_souls reads the Θ OFFSET, never the absolute Θ_node.</b> D3's own formula
/// (<see cref="SoulTrack.ThetaNode"/>) is `Θ_actor + Ws·soulLevel/1000` -- every tree shares the SAME
/// `Θ_actor` floor, so a Herfindahl index over the absolute `Θ_node` values would dilute concentration
/// by a flat cross-tree constant that carries no investment information at all.
/// <see cref="TreeModel"/>'s own `H_nodes` is a Herfindahl over an INVESTMENT AMOUNT
/// (<c>OwnedNodeCount</c>, never a tier-inclusive absolute power number); `H_souls` is built the same
/// way here, over the per-tree OFFSET (`ThetaNode(...) - Θ_actor`, exactly `Ws·soulLevel_i/1000`) so
/// the two tracks feed <see cref="Concentration.HerfindahlMilli"/> the same KIND of quantity.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Reuses <see cref="TreeModel.Resolve"/> for everything the point track already computed.</b>
/// `W_i` (<see cref="TreeModel.PerTreeState.TreePower"/>) does not depend on `F`, so it is safe to
/// borrow directly from a plain <see cref="TreeModel.Resolve"/> call and refold it under a NEW `F`
/// computed from the real `H_souls` -- never a second, parallel tier/gate computation that could drift
