"""
Magic-number audit — the balance surface must be config, not code.

Standard: docs/architecture/tunables-ssot.md

    T1  a number a balance pass would change lives in config
    T2  a structural const says why it is not tunable
    T3  no bare numeric literal in a balance-surface file
    T6  every tunable carries its unit

Precision over coverage. `audit-overflow.py`'s first run reported 121 critical findings and every
one was a false positive; the exempt lists below are the lesson from that, not timidity.

Usage (repo root):
    python scripts/audit-magic-numbers.py                  # full report
    python scripts/audit-magic-numbers.py --domain contracts
    python scripts/audit-magic-numbers.py --category M1
    python scripts/audit-magic-numbers.py --targets M1     # bare file:line list
    python scripts/audit-magic-numbers.py --summary        # per-domain counts only

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = HIGH findings present, 2 = usage error.

# Named explicitly, not folded into a broader regex — same discipline CONTENT_FILE already uses:
# a deliberate, reviewable exception rather than a silent broadening of BALANCE_WORD/STRUCTURAL_WORD
# that could swallow a real future finding sharing the same substring.
#
# `KernelDriveHost.KindShieldUpkeep` (Injector/Effects) is an opaque scheduler-kind discriminator —
# its own doc comment: "Opaque ints to the queue by design — the scheduler never interprets them."
# It matches BALANCE_WORD only because "Shield" + "Upkeep" happen to be substrings of an id, the same
# accidental-substring class audit-overflow.py's own "WithPatron"/"hP" note already warns about.
#
# `KernelDriveHost.UpkeepPeriodTicks` is a scheduling GRANULARITY, not a balance rate — its own doc
# comment: "structural, not tunable... It stays 100 ms deliberately" (integer milli-HP regen would
# truncate to zero at finer granularity). T2 already requires this exact justification in a comment;
# this constant already carries it and was still flagged because "upkeep" is deliberately in
# BALANCE_WORD (a real resource-upkeep RATE elsewhere is a genuine balance dial).
#
# `VariantShift.MaxTier`/`MinTier` (Core/Effects/Atoms) — "which tier ROWS exist" (a schema fact: t5
# is the highest tier row authored, there is no t6), not a magnitude a balance pass scales. Its own
# doc comment names this exact audit by function: "named here so a later overflow/magic-number sweep
# does not flag ShiftTierWindow's clamp as an illegal cap." Matched via BALANCE_WORD's "tier", which
# elsewhere (a tier-scaled bonus, say) is correctly a real balance dial — the exemption is these two
# specific identifiers, not the word.
#
# `FamilyExpansion.TierCount`/`ReferenceLevel`/`BandFloorPermille`/`BandCeilingPermille` (E43,
# Core/Effects/Atoms/Generation) mirror `bands.v1.json`'s FROZEN `powerBand.tierScaling` values
# verbatim — the same "5, one per tier the atom layer already has" fact `MaxTier`/`MinTier` above are
# exempt for, and the same reasoning: a balance pass that wants to move these mints a v2 of that
# frozen, versioned registry file (its own `frozenNote`: "No in-place edit... registryVersion 2 plus
# an explicit decision"), it never edits this constant directly. Matched via BALANCE_WORD's
# "tier"/"level"/"band" — real per-family balance data (`sharePermille`) lives in
# `tier-bands.v1.json`, read at runtime by the same module, not as a `const` here.
# `TurnReadiness.SpeedScale` (battle-timeline T14/B28, 2026-09-04) is the readiness formula's UNIT OF
# MEASURE, and it matches BALANCE_WORD purely on the substring "scale" — the same accidental-substring
# class the two entries above are here for. "Scale" in BALANCE_WORD means a multiplier a balance pass
# turns up; here it means the scale numbers are *expressed in*. TicksFor computes
# `work × SpeedScale / rate` where the work supplied and the rate compared are in these same units, so
# changing it scales numerator and denominator together and cancels: nobody gets faster, the timeline is
# merely described at a different granularity. The half of that constant that IS a balance dial was
# split out in the same change and moved to config as derived-stats' `turnDefaultSpeed` — so exempting
# this name hides nothing, because the tunable half is no longer in code at all.

    # `UniqueBudget.AeScale = 100` matches "scale". It is not a scale a balance pass turns -- it is
    # the INTEGER ENCODING of the affix-equivalent unit. `item_unique.budget_ae` stores AE x 100
    # because SC4 forbids floats in content, so changing this changes what the column MEANS, not how
    # strong a unique is. The number a balance pass actually turns is budgetPremiumAeHundredths, which
    # is in data/tuning/uniques.v1.json. Same kind of thing as the already-exempt ReferenceLevel.
    #
    # `UniqueLimits.FixedCoreChannelWeightMilli = 0` matches "weight". It is the one value in this
    # program that is zero BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by tuning: effect-pipeline L0 turns a power
    # class into a POOL RATE, and a unique's identity atoms are fixed-core rows that are never drawn,
    # so there is no draw for a weight to modify. Making it configurable would invite someone to set

    # `ConsumableLimits.MinManifestCost = 1` matches "cost". It is not a price -- it is the FLOOR that
    # makes the belt limit a limit at all: a consumable occupying zero manifest places is free, so any

    # matching maximum, because a strong draught costing several places is what the column is for.
