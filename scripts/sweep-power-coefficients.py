Power-coefficient sweep — E44 `power-sweep`, acceptance criteria 1 and 3.

Spec: docs/architecture/effect-atom/spec-power-sweep.md §4.1
SSOT: docs/architecture/power/ssot-power-scale.md (numeric contract: long, widen before
multiplying, divide by 1000 last, overflow throws)

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Loads the real generated-atom corpus under data/seed/atoms/generated/ (E43 `family-expand`,
currently 45 rows across 3 files: g-armour.json, g-attack.json, g-life.json) and computes the real
observed magnitude distribution per (kind, channel), split by `op` — `flat` (a raw stat-unit
delta), `increased` / `more` (a percentage modifier). Both share the same channel and therefore the
same `CoefficientTable` row, but are NOT the same unit — see FINDING 2 below.

`CoefficientTable`'s own contract (`PowerCoefficientRow.ReferenceScale`'s doc comment) ties
`ReferenceScale` to "what one RAW unit means for this channel" — i.e. the `flat` op's own unit.
That is the one sub-corpus this table's key granularity (kind × channel, no `op` axis) can actually
fit without conflating two different units under one number. This script therefore fits `CoeffMilli`
(the value spec §2/§4.1 names as "the flat 1000s") from the median `flat`-op magnitude of each
channel, holding `ReferenceScale` at its existing authored value (2/2/10/10 — already a reasonable,
pre-existing per-channel unit pick that this sweep does not need to re-derive, since the spec's own
inventory table already lists ReferenceScale as the dial that "varies", only CoeffMilli is flat).

FORMULA (integer, per-mille, one rounding point — mirrors CostFunction.PriceForChannel exactly):

    normalizedMilli(mag)  = round(mag * 1000 / referenceScale)     # div-round half away from zero
    price(mag, coeffMilli) = round(normalizedMilli(mag) * coeffMilli / 1000)

    fittedCoeffMilli(channel) = round(
        TARGET_POINTS * 1000 / normalizedMilli(medianFlatMagnitude(channel))
    )

TARGET_POINTS = 1000 mirrors the existing "one reference unit = 1000 pts" convention already used
elsewhere in this codebase (`RungPowerBudgetTests`' own `referencePower = PowerMath.One`) — not a
number invented for this sweep.

WHY MEDIAN, NOT MEAN: only 5 tiers per family; the median (=tier 3, the middle tier) is the same
robust "pin one representative point, not an average of a range no one exemplar hits" choice
ssot-power-scale.md §4.3 uses for its own single calibration point (`P(20) = 680`).

FINDING 1 (fit result): with CoeffMilli fitted this way, the four channels' median (tier-3) `flat`
atom prices converge from a 3.7x spread (might/atk=4500, warding/defense=2000, mending/hp=7400,
vitality/maxHp=7400, under the flat-1000 baseline) to 999-1000 across the board — measured, not
asserted; see the printed table.

FINDING 2 (structural limit, reported honestly per spec §7 criterion 7 — NOT fixed here, out of
scope): `increased`/`more` atoms sharing these same 4 channels carry percentage magnitudes (e.g.
23-47 at tier 1, regardless of channel) that are numerically indistinguishable, at this table's
(kind, channel) key granularity, from a `flat` atom's raw-unit magnitude. No choice of CoeffMilli or
ReferenceScale can reconcile the two without widening the coefficient key to include `op` — a
CostFunction/CoefficientTable lookup-key change, out of E44's scope (a coefficient-DATA change).
This is scale-invariant: rescaling CoeffMilli or ReferenceScale moves both op-classes by the same
factor and never changes the ratio between them. Reported so a later module owns it explicitly
rather than rediscovering it.

COVERAGE — ⛔ CORRECTED 2026-09-05. An earlier pass of this script claimed the other 16 rows "have
zero real corpus under data/seed/atoms/ today". **That was wrong**, and only true of the GENERATED
sub-tree it happened to glob. The SHIPPED catalog (`data/seed/atoms/fx-*.json`) carries real atoms
for status.apply (6), spawn.entity (3), shield.grant (3), and one each of board.action, grid.spawn,
grid.clear, box.set, resource.delta, resource.economy, status.clear, stat.derived. That catalog is
what actually ships to players, so it is real content, not the "synthetic data" §5 forbids fitting
against.

The real reason most of those rows still cannot be FITTED is sharper, structural, and permanent —
it is a property of the kind, not a shortage of content. `CostFunction.MeanMagnitude` walks a kind's
own declared params for the first `ParamKind.Value` one; **a kind that declares none has no
magnitude at all and returns a fixed `1`** ("one reference unit ... so it prices as 'one of whatever
this kind does'", its own doc comment). For those kinds every atom prices identically no matter how
much content exists, so there is no distribution to fit and the coefficient is a pure balance-policy
choice, not a measurement. No amount of future content changes that. Measured against the real
registry and the real corpus, per row:

  * FITTABLE, real distribution ... stat.modify atk/defense/hp/maxHp (fitted, below) and
                                    status.apply (`duration`: 2,3,3,4,5,5 — fitted, below)
  * single real value only ....... resource.economy (amount=25, n=1), stat.derived (amount=150, n=1)
                                    — a normalisation of one point, not a fit; left authored
  * NO magnitude param at all .... status.clear, shield.grant, board.action, grid.spawn, grid.clear,
                                    box.set, resource.delta — magnitude is structurally fixed at 1;
                                    coefficient is a policy choice, permanently unfittable
  * priced off a DIFFERENT path .. spawn.entity — its body goes through
                                    `ActorPowerCache.PriceBody(hp, atk)` (CostFunction.SpawnBody),
                                    not this coefficient's normalisation, so its hp/atk magnitudes
                                    must NOT be fitted into this row
  * no real atom of any kind ..... arm1/arm1Max/arm2/arm2Max — genuinely awaiting content
