"""
Reader census — which aptitude-tuning families have a shipped consumer, computed fresh.

class-system-todo.md P1.5/P1.6 produced this classification ONCE, by hand: a general-purpose
agent grepped src/ for readers and wrote the result into DerivedStatChannels.cs's
CombatFamilyUnitClass dict + data/seed/derived-stats/catalog.json's per-family notes. P1.5's own
verify line required "the census script is checked in and re-runnable" but no script was ever
built — data/tuning/aptitudes.v2.json's _meta.measurable field has carried that one-time manual
count as free-form PROSE ever since, with no way to notice if it goes stale. This is that script
(class-system-todo.md P8.4).

WHAT "HAS A READER" MEANS (family granularity, matching familyRead's own granularity — not
per-resource-id/per-element): a channel family (e.g. "combat.power", "status.duration") has a
reader if ANY line under src/FusionRpg.Core/ calls `.Get(...)` with a channel under that family's
prefix. Two detection modes:

  DIRECT   `<snapshot>.Get(DerivedStatChannels.X)` or `.Get(DerivedStatChannels.X(arg))` — X is a
           named constant or generator method declared in DerivedStatChannels.cs. Unambiguous:
           the identifier alone determines the family. High confidence.

  DYNAMIC  `<snapshot>.Get($"status.{family}.omni")` — a C# interpolated string literal passed
           straight to .Get(...), never going through a DerivedStatChannels.* identifier at all
           (ResistanceEvaluator.cs's status-potency reads are the one shipped example). The
           family is recovered by turning the template's literal (non-{}) fragments into a regex
           (holes become `[^.]*` — every shipped hole fills one dotted path segment or a
           mid-segment word fragment, never text containing a literal ".") and testing it against
           each family's own known concrete channel strings. THIS IS A HEURISTIC, not a proof: a
           regex cannot see that `family` is only ever assigned "duration"/"intensity" at the call
           site, so it can still over-match a template against a sibling channel that happens to
           fit the same literal shape. CONFIRMED CASE (worth reading before trusting DYNAMIC
           evidence blindly): ResistanceEvaluator.cs:331's `$"status.{family}.omni"` template
           matches status.duration.omni as intended, but its `[^.]*` hole is equally happy to
           consume the whole word "durationReduction", so it ALSO matches status.durationReduction
           .omni even though that channel's real evidence is line 334's sibling template two lines
           down. The verdict (status.durationReduction has a reader) is still correct either way —
           both templates live in the same function — but the CITED line can be the less specific
           of two matches. Every DYNAMIC hit is reported as "possible reader, verify manually",
           never with DIRECT's confidence, precisely because of cases like this one.

SCOPE — read this before comparing this script's total family count against P1.5's own "21 + 8 =
29": P1.5/P1.6 only classified the 29 families added by the H.1-H.7 catalog-extension registration
pass (derived-stats program, 2026-08-24) — NOT the 19 older, pre-existing families (the original
12 combat.* channels, the 5 progression.bonus.* channels, and status.power/status.resist) that
already had readers from before that program existed and were never part of the P1.5 pass. This
script has no such scope limit: it censuses all 48 families familyRead itself lists, every run.
Cross-checking this script's output against P1.5/P1.6's numbers is therefore only meaningful on
the 29-family subset that carries an explicit "Reader VERIFIED" / "No reader" citation in
catalog.json (--crosscheck does exactly that subset, not all 48).

Usage (repo root):
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py                 # full human-readable report
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py --summary        # counts only
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py --json            # machine-readable report (stdout)
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py --targets NOREADER   # bare family list, no reader
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py --targets READER     # bare family list, has a reader
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py --check            # compare vs _meta.measurable's prose
    python scripts/audit-reader-census.py --crosscheck        # compare vs catalog.json's 21+8

Exit codes: 0 = ran cleanly (report modes) / --check or --crosscheck agrees with ground truth;
            1 = --check or --crosscheck found a disagreement; 2 = usage error.
