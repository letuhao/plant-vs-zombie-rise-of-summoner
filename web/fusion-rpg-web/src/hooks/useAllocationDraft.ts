/**
 * The shared draft/dirty/budget/save flow `AptitudesPage.tsx` and `ProgressionTab.tsx` each hand-rolled
 * (passive-tree-todo.md I2, spec-tree-surface.md §12). `ProgressionTab.tsx`'s own comment named the
 * fix before this task landed: "the aptitude half is AptitudesPage.tsx's own draft/dirty/budget/save
 * logic, copied verbatim... If this drifts, the fix is extracting a shared useAptitudeAllocation()
 * hook, not maintaining two copies by hand." This is that extraction, generalised past aptitudes: a
 * tree-spend flow (I3+) reads/writes a `Record<string, number>` allocation exactly the same shape
 * (skill points here, souls or aptitude points there), so the hook takes the server values, budget and
 * save callback as plain inputs rather than importing an aptitude-specific bus hook itself.
 *
 * Draft rules preserved byte-for-byte from the two call sites this replaces:
 * - the draft re-seeds from the server ONLY the first time server data arrives (never while the
 *   player is mid-edit — re-seeding on every server refetch would silently discard an unsaved edit);
 * - `spent` sums the draft's own values, `withinBudget` never clamps the input (PS-8) -- a value over
 *   budget still renders exactly what was typed, only the save affordance disables;
 * - `dirty` is a value comparison against the server's last-known state, not the draft's own history.
