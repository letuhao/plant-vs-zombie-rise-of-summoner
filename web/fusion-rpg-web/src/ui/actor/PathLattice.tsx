 * **A CSS grid, never a graph library** (§2.3: "Do not reach for a graph library. A 2x10 lattice is a
 * CSS grid... `LockedGridSlot.tsx` is already the cell.") — `xyflowGuard.test.ts` enforces the "not a

 *
 * **GG-61, not GG-50** (§2.3): all of a path's cells mount directly, no windowing/virtualization —
 * the opposite failure mode from `PathBrowse.tsx`'s 39-path list, which GG-50 covers instead.
 *
 * **The locked reason is visible sibling text, never a `title`** — `ActionCluster.tsx:18-29` already
 * settled this for world verbs (`disabledReasonGuard.ts` accepts a bare `title` as its floor, but "a
 * hover-only reason is unreachable on touch and invisible to a keyboard user"); the same real
 * `<p data-testid=...>` sibling pattern is used here, queried by text in tests, never by `title`.
