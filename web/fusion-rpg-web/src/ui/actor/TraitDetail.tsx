/**
 * passive-tree-todo.md I7 — Level 3, the trait detail (spec-tree-surface.md §4, §8). Pushed from
 * `PathLattice.tsx` (Level 2) exactly the way Level 2 is pushed from `PathBrowse.tsx` (Level 1) --
 * `PassivesTab.tsx`'s own `openTreeId`/`setOpenTreeId` push-state pattern, extended one level with
 * `openNodeId`/`setOpenNodeId`, never a parallel navigation mechanism.
 *
 * **One verb per cell, three states (§4)** — this file reads the SAME `cellStateFor` I6's own
 * `TraitCell` already renders (imported straight from `passivesLattice.ts`), so Level 2 and Level 3
 * can never disagree about whether a node is owned, available or locked.
 *
 * **The deepen control is a STEPPER, never a slider or a raw-id `NumberInput`** (§4 rule 1: "a slider
 * needs a maximum; PS-8 forbids one"; rule 2: "a 40-trait grid must not inherit" the raw-id defect at
 * `AptitudesPage.tsx:64-65`). No shared Stepper component exists anywhere in this app today (searched:
 * zero hits) -- these are three plain `Button`s, matching §4's own worked example (`[ - ] [ + ]
 * [ +10 ]`), each with a real `aria-label`, never a bare numeric `<input>`.
 *
 * **The step edits the DRAFT, not the server** (§4 rule 3) -- `useAllocationDraft` (I2's own shared
 * hook, extracted for exactly this: "a tree-spend flow reads/writes a Record<string, number>
 * allocation exactly the same shape"), never a lattice-local sibling. `budget: Infinity` is the
 * literal rendering of PS-8 ("souls are uncapped") through a hook whose own contract is "never clamps
 * to the budget, only to a legal non-negative integer" -- `withinBudget` is simply always true, which
 * is the honest state for an uncapped currency, not a fabricated cap.
 *
 * **A nullified trait renders INERT, never un-unlocked** (§8, D40) -- `traitNotWorking` reads the
 * exact same union `passivesYours.ts`'s Level-0 count already reads, so this card and that count can
 * never disagree about which traits have stopped working.
 *
 * **The finding is a toast (GG-16), never a modal** (§8 "Finding it without opening thirty-nine
 * paths", part 2) -- a successful save diffs the tree's own excluded-node set before/after
 * (`newlyInertFindings`, pure) and pushes one `useToastStack` toast per newly-inert trait, naming both
 * the trait and its winner. No dialog shell or its band class anywhere in this file —
 * `bandGuard.test.ts` scans the real tree for exactly that.
