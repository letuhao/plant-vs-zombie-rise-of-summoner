 * GG-17's own "Testable as" line: "Per surface, four render tests." Its baseline ("2 of 20 pages
 * handle query error at all") is the *pre-refactor* legacy page count (`gap-audit-2026-08-22.md`),
 * not this refactor's own surfaces — conflating the two would misattribute a decade of legacy debt
 * to this phase. This file declares the current, real status of every data surface this refactor
 * actually owns or touches, so a new one added without checking all four states can't go quiet.
