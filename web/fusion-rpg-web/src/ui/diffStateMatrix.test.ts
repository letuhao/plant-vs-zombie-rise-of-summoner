/**
 * GG-47's own "Testable as" line: "Every picker surface renders a diff state in its test matrix."
 * Checkpoint G's audit found real diff-state coverage (RelicsLayer's equipped-vs-candidate
 * comparison) but no *declared* inventory of which picker surfaces exist and whether each complies
 * — a silent single instance, not a checked list. This file is that list. Adding a new picker
 * surface without updating it is the thing this test exists to make impossible to do quietly.
 *
 * GG-47 names the domain explicitly: "relics, creatures, skills, contracts, sectors." Only one of
 * those is a real, built comparison UI today — the other four either don't exist as comparison
 * surfaces yet, or their comparison UI is a task this phase excluded after checking the real
 * backend (matching T21/T23's own documented findings, not a new claim invented here).
