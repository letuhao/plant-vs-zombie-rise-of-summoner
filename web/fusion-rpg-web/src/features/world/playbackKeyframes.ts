 * constraint `turnPlayback.ts`'s own `toKeyframes` documents. `report.phases` is the full ordered
 * list of every phase the *engine* ran this turn (`TurnEngine.cs:44-63`, `BeginPhase` called
 * unconditionally per phase), including one with zero entries — grouping by that list, not by the
 * entries actually seen, is what keeps an empty phase from silently vanishing instead of rendering
 * its own "nothing happened" heading. `focusId` reads the entry's own `sectorId` field directly
 * (`WorldDtos.cs:485`, "where it happened, when it happened anywhere") rather than parsing it back
 * out of `detail`, which `turnPlayback.ts`'s older `focusOf` had to do before that field existed.
