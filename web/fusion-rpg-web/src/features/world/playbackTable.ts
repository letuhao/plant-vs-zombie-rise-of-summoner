/**
 * The one translation table (world-stage W72). `classify()` used to recognise five prefixes and
 * print the raw string on everything else (`turnPlayback.ts`'s old `classify`/`describe`), so a
 * turn in which the empire starved read literally `dave loam.shortfall:340` and a refused order
 * read `t3-move-e-dave-legion-1 dropped — path.not-contiguous`. **It is one table, not per-prefix
 * handling** — per-prefix handling is precisely how the 5-of-21 state arose.
 *
 * **The real inventory is 68 tokens, not the task's own stated 63** — audited directly against the
 * C# source (not estimated) before writing any row, and the discrepancy is real, not a miscount
 * carried over: 22 event prefixes (not 21 — `supply.cut`/`recovery` live in `SupplyGraph.cs`, a
 * file outside the task's own original hint list) and 41 drop reasons (not 37 — most of the gap is
 * `MarchResolver.cs`'s 7 tokens, also outside the hint list, reached only via
 * `MovementPhase.cs:48`, plus several resolver-level reasons beyond `WorldCommandAdmission.cs`
 * alone). Battle kinds (3) and calendar subjects (2) matched exactly. Every token below is cited to
 * its real file:line.
