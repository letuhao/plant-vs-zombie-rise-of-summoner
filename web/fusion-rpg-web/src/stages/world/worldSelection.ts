 * `world-stage` W66: widened from three kinds to eight, matching `WorldCommand.All`'s own live

 * (with its `stance` posture field), `sustain` (with `amount`), `build` (with `structureId` and
 * `slotIndex`), alongside the original `move`/`clear`/`claim`. **`ward` is the one member that is
 * type-complete but unreachable today**: the task this widening was planned against names it as a
 * lane-scoped order, but `WorldCommand.cs:44-49`'s own comment is explicit that `ward` — raising a
 * lane's `WardLevel` — "names the still-unbuilt lane action" and is deliberately distinct from the
 * real, already-shipped `bind-warden` (a sector order). No `WorldCommandAdmission.cs` case exists
 * for it, so a `ward`-kind order would always be refused as an unknown kind if actually filed —
 * the type accepts it (and `toRequests` maps its `laneId` faithfully) so the queue's own shape is
 * ready the day the engine catches up, but nothing in this program's UI produces one yet, matching
 * the same "never draw a verb the vocabulary lacks" rule the cede embargo (W59/W60) established.
 * `cede` and `bind-warden` (also real commands today, `world-commands` W24/W28) are deliberately
 * **not** added here: both act immediately rather than joining a march-style queue a player reviews
 * before committing, so they don't fit `PendingOrder`'s own shape — a scope boundary, not an
 * oversight.
