 * The band-1 top strip (world-stage W52) — empire-scope only, four readings through `LoamFigure`
 * (`world-numbers` W39), never a per-sector or per-component number: `resource-hub-ssot.md` §4
 * forbids mixing scopes on one surface, and this is the empire-scope surface. Built as a pure,
 * unwired component per this task's own Files list — `WorldHud.tsx`'s `topStrip` slot is where a
 * caller mounts it once real empire totals are threaded through (the wiring gap logged at W50).
 *
 * A `flex-wrap` row rather than a fixed-width one: at 200% text scale the four readings wrap onto a
 * second line instead of clipping or silently reordering — nothing here fixes a pixel width on
 * text content, which is the one thing that would break that guarantee.
 *
 * Turn and calendar (world-stage W53) share this strip per `spec-world-hud.md`'s own arbitration —
 * both are "this module." The calendar slot is a calendar, never a season (§8b.7): the label carries
 * only day/week/month numbers plus whichever of plague/specialMonth/specialWeek the server actually
 * rolled, sourced from `WorldStateDto.Calendar`, never a `calendar` report entry (blank six turns in
 * seven).
