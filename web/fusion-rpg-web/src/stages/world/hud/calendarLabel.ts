/**
 * The calendar slot's data (world-stage W53) — `WorldStateDto.Calendar` (`world-wire` W15), never a
 * `calendar` report entry (`TurnEngine.cs:225-231` only emits one on a week boundary, blank six
 * turns out of seven). `TurnCalendar.cs` is pure in `(turn, seed)`; the seed never reaches the wire,
 * but `DaysPerWeek`/`WeeksPerMonth` do, and placing today's turn in its week and month from those two
 * public tunables is ordinary calendar arithmetic — not a re-derivation of the hidden roll, which
 * only ever decides the boolean flags below.
 *
 * **§8b.7's premise no longer holds.** It read "this is a calendar, not a season — no season name,
 * no 'Long Wither'" at a time there was no season concept in the turn engine at all. Sector-development
 * has since shipped one (`TurnCalendar.SeasonOf`, real, hashed, replayed, never fogged), and the owner
 * decided directly (2026-09-05, asked because §8b.7 was a documented decision, not silently overridden)
 * to wire it into this slot. `season` is a plain 0-indexed number: no season-name catalog exists
 * anywhere in the engine or `data/tuning/world.v5.json`, and inventing flavour text here would be a
 * content decision this task was never asked to make — "Season 2", not "Long Wither".
