 * happened" line, never a silent gap.
 *
 * Purely presentational: this component reads `activeIndex`, it does not own it — `PlaybackTransport`
 * is what advances it, and `foldTurnReport`/`flattenKeyframes` (`features/world/playbackKeyframes.ts`)
 * already did all the folding, so this file never touches a `*Dto` type at all.
