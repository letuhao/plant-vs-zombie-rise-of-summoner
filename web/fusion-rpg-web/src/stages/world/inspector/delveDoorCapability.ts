 * The world-map door's own "which slot kind opens a delve" rule (party-dungeon D1.28, acceptance:
 * "reuses the four existing slot kinds Lair · Tear · Vault · Anomaly (`SlotTypeCatalog.cs:14-20`)
 * mapped to domain themes — no new SlotKind", decision 14). The four ids below are
 * `SlotTypeCatalog.cs`'s own `SlotTypeId` literals for `SlotKind.Lair`/`.Tear`/`.Vault`/`.Anomaly`
 * (`World/SlotTypeCatalog.cs:70-76`) — reused verbatim, never re-derived, and never a fifth kind.
 *
 * **What "mapped to domain themes" means here, precisely, after reading the real wire (2026-09-07):**
 * `DomainRow.Theme` (`Delve/Domains/DomainRow.cs:23`) is Core-only content — `DomainOffers.For`
 * (`Delve/Domains/DomainOffers.cs:95-103`) builds `DomainOfferDto` field-by-field and never copies
 * `Theme` onto it, so no domain "theme" value ever reaches this file; there is nothing on the wire to
 * read. And the six real domain seed files that do exist (`data/seed/dungeon/domains/*.json`) carry a
 * `theme` shaped like a creature-species reference (e.g. `domain.fire-001.json`'s own
 * `"theme": "creature.scaredyshroom"`), not an English word a slot kind could sensibly match against —
 * there is no live or content-authored link from a world-map slot kind to a specific domain anywhere
 * in the system today (a real, separate gap, named here rather than papered over with an invented
 * link). So the only mapping actually buildable today is the one this module owns: the map slot's
 * OWN kind name (`SlotTypeCatalog.cs`'s own `Name` field) doubles as the door's display "theme" — a
 * labelling reuse, not a content filter. *Which* real domain the door then offers comes from the live
 * catalog instead (`useDelveDomainOffers`, `lib/bus/world.ts`), never from this table.
