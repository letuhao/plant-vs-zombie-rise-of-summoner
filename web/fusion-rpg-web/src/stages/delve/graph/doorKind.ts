/**
 * Door-kind visual rules (D5.4, spec-delve-stage.md §4/§7: "doors, gates, one-way arrows, secret dead
 * ends"). `DoorView.typeId` (`contract/types.ts:1045`) is the wire's only signal for what kind of
 * door this is — there is no boolean `oneWay`/`gated`/`hidden` field on the wire at all.
 *
 * **This is a named, deliberate client-side reading of a small closed server registry, not a wire
 * contract field — say so plainly.** `data/seed/dungeon/_registry/door-kinds.v1.json` (verified this
 * session, byte for byte) names exactly four door-kind ids and their flags: passage (nothing set),
 * gated (gated), one-way (oneWay), secret (hidden).
 *
 * `DoorTypeCatalog.cs` (`Core/Delve/DoorTypeCatalog.cs:7-16`) projects this registry into
 * `LaneTypeDef.{OneWay,Gated}` server-side for `WorldValidation`, but — exactly like
 * `RoomTypeCatalog.cs`'s own sibling doc comment about room kinds — **the registry itself is never
 * served to the client** (confirmed: zero hits for "door-kind"/"doorKind" anywhere under
 * `web/fusion-rpg-web/src`, and no catalog route under `/api/` exposes it). So this module hardcodes the
 * four ids as a closed, small, presentation-only vocabulary — the same kind of client-side closed-set
 * switch `RoomView.kind`'s own eleven-id table already is (spec §8) — rather than adding a fifth wire
 * round trip for four rows that essentially never change shape. If the registry ever grows a fifth
 * kind, this module fails safe (see the default arm below), it does not throw.
 *
 * **Never confuse this with `DoorView.gateKeyId`, which IS a real wire field** — `typeId === "gated"`
 * and `gateKeyId != null` are two different signals that happen to agree on every row the registry
 * defines today (only the `"gated"` kind ever carries a key). This module treats `gateKeyId != null`
 * as authoritative for "this door needs a key" — a real field beats an inferred one — and `typeId`
 * only for the one thing the wire truly cannot say: one-way vs. secret vs. plain.
