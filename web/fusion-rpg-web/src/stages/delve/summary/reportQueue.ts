/**
 * D5.9 (spec-delve-stage.md §7's band-4 row: "Drops · level-ups · a wild creature joining · a first
 * clear … Queued, never racing band 3: a report arriving while the summary is open waits behind it").
 *
 * **A genuinely separate mechanism from the shell's own `toastStack.ts`, layered on top of it rather
 * than duplicating its rendering — a deliberate choice, not the only one, so the reasoning is written
 * down.** `shell/Toasts.tsx`/`toastStack.ts` already exists, is mounted shell-wide, and its own
 * `VISIBLE_CAP = 3` (`Toasts.tsx:13`) caps how many toasts are *shown at once* — anything past that
 * sits behind a `"+N more"` count, never merged (`Toasts.tsx:27-31`). Spec §12's own `reveal.maxQueued`
 * (`data/tuning/delve-ui.v1.json`: `"reveal": {"toastMs": 4000, "maxQueued": 3}`) is a **different**
 * rule with the same number: "above [3], queued reports **collapse into one summary report**" — a
 * content merge, not a display cap, and it only applies to reports that arrived **while held** (i.e.
 * while the extraction summary, band 3, was open), never to the shell's general-purpose toast traffic.
 * Reusing `toastStack.ts`'s own store/render pipeline for the actual on-screen band-4 surface (no
 * second `<Toasts/>`-shaped component, no second ARIA live region, no second dismiss affordance) and
 * adding this queue as a thin, delve-only layer *in front of* it is the smaller, more honest change:
 * it reuses real, already-mounted UI for the parts that are genuinely identical (a band-4 card that
 * auto-expires and never blocks input) and owns only the parts that are genuinely delve-specific (the
 * hold-while-band-3-is-open rule and the maxQueued collapse), rather than mutating `toastStack.ts`'s
 * own generic semantics for every other caller in the app to carry a delve-only rule.
 *
 * **No real production caller exists for `push` today, named honestly rather than hidden**: no
 * producer anywhere composes a drop/level-up/join/first-clear event at the extraction boundary
 * (`ExtractionView`'s own doc comment, `contract/types.ts:1292-1296`: "'level-ups' and 'joins' … have
 * no producer anywhere … every one of those stays `Pending`, named, rather than invented"). This
 * module is the queuing MECHANISM only — the timing/ordering/collapse rule — built and proven against
 * a caller-supplied `{kind, title, message}` shape a future producer will fill in; it does not invent
 * per-kind display copy for content nobody has authored yet (the same restraint
 * `ObjectPromptPanel.tsx`'s own doc comment already applies to an unbuilt per-verb shape).
