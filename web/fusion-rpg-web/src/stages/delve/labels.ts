/**
 * D5.10 (spec-delve-stage.md §8) — the delve program's one id → message table. "Vocabulary travels
 * as an id and is translated by `src/stages/delve/labels.ts` … there is no second registry to keep
 * in step" (§8, verbatim). Shaped like `stages/world/labels.ts`: several small, pure, total
 * functions — one per closed vocabulary — rather than one giant object literal, so each stays
 * independently readable and each unknown-id fallback sits next to its own reasoning.
 *
 * **Plain strings, not Lingui `msg` descriptors — a deliberate, named choice, not an oversight.**
 * §8's own text says these messages "live in `src/i18n/locales/en/messages.po` (Lingui
 * `msg`/`Trans`)", but the one real sibling this task was told to mirror — `stages/world/labels.ts`
 * — is plain, un-internationalized TypeScript (confirmed by reading it in full: no `@lingui/macro`
 * import anywhere in it), and no non-JSX `.ts` file anywhere in this tree yet builds an id→`msg`
 * lookup table (the only hit for `@lingui/macro` outside a `.tsx` file is `i18n/reactivityGuard.ts`,
 * a scanner that looks for `msg`/`Trans` call sites, not a label source itself — confirmed by grep).
 * Built plain, matching the real, existing convention this task was told to follow rather than a
 * spec sentence no shipped code yet demonstrates. Out of v1 anyway (§11: "no second locale … of any
 * kind" for this whole module) — the Lingui migration is a real, open, named gap for whichever task
 * first needs a second delve locale, not decided here.
 *
 * **Folded in from `graph/roomKindLabels.ts`'s own pull-forward, per that file's own header note**
 * ("this table's eleven room-kind rows plus four banner rows are the literal content D5.10 should
 * fold in, not re-author") — `roomKindLabel` and `partyBannerLabel` below carry the identical id set
 * and identical wording that file already established (independently re-derived here from the same
 * spec citations before this file was cross-checked against it, and found byte-for-byte identical).
 * **Two fallback arms deliberately differ, named precisely rather than silently matched:**
 * `graph/roomKindLabels.ts`'s own `roomKindLabel` falls back to the raw wire id for an unrecognised
 * kind (`ROOM_KIND_LABELS[kind] ?? kind`) and its own `partyBannerLabel` falls back to a bare ordinal
 * for an out-of-range index (`` `Banner ${partyIndex + 1}` ``) — both explicitly reasoned there as
 * "never crash the graph," and both currently unreachable (`RoomKindCatalog` is a closed,
 * load-validated 11-member enum; `raidMode` tops out at `quad`, four parties). But an engine id or a
 * bare ordinal reaching player text is exactly what GG-23 (§8) and D5.6's own
 * `Party_labels_are_names_not_indices` forbid if either vocabulary ever grows without both files
 * updating together — this module's own fallbacks below never leak either shape. `graph/` is this
 * session's explicitly out-of-bounds concurrent work (D5.4, mid-build) and is not edited here; this
 * is named for whoever consolidates the two callers onto this file's exports.
 *
 * Every function below is closed and total over a small, catalog-validated vocabulary
 * (`RaidModeCatalog`/`raid-modes.v1.json`, `RoomKindCatalog`/`room-kinds.v1.json`,
 * `NervePolicy`/`bands.v1.json`'s `nerveStage` band, `DomainOffers.EntryKeyStanding`/
 * `EntryKeySingleDescent`) — every id set below was read directly from the working tree, not taken
 * from the spec's prose alone. None of these throws: an id outside the known set is a real
 * version-skew defect, not a normal "still loading" gap, so each function falls back to a named,
 * safe member instead of crashing or leaking the wire token — the same shape `contract/adapt.ts`'s
 * own `toDomainEntryKey` already established for exactly this situation ("an unrecognised wire value
 * falls back to the more permissive reading").

 * deliberately does not take it — the caller renders it on its own, the same "figure/flag rendered by

 *   would have nothing real to translate yet — adding one would invite exactly the "adapter invents
 *   the missing value" defect `contract/types.ts`'s own module comment already names as a rule.
 * - Member status (`Downed` / `Recovering(n)` / `Retired` / `won` / `Retreated`, §8 row 6) — **built
 *   above, D5.9** (`extractionOutcomeLabel`): the real producer (`ExtractionSettlement.SettlementOutcome`)

 *   (`contract/adaptDelve.test.ts:373-374`, `contract/delveViews.test.ts:166`, both feeding
 *   `outcome: "Roster"` / `"Recover"`). This bullet used to name the mismatch and defer the function to
 *   "whichever task next touches `ExtractionView`" — that task is `summary/ExtractionSummary.tsx`.
 * - Sight (`SectorSight`, §8 row 7) — deliberately not a word: "a drawn treatment," per §8's own
 *   text, and `graph/sightTreatment.ts` (D5.4) already keys off the raw `DelveSightState` value
 *   directly rather than rendering "Unlit"/"Glimpsed"/"Seen" anywhere.
 * - Door/lane state (`DelveDoorState`, `"Open" | "Severed"`) — never named as player-facing words
 *   anywhere in §8's table; left alone rather than inventing wording no spec section asks for.
 * - The six object-prompt verbs and the eight wild-talk verbs — **built above, D5.7** (`objectVerbLabel`
 *   / `wildVerbLabel` / `objectKindLabel`): `layers/ObjectPromptPanel.tsx` and `layers/TalkPanel.tsx`

 *   (Descend/Extract/Retreat's own titles and messages) is built directly in
 *   `stages/delve/confirms/*.tsx` — none of it is id-shaped vocabulary (each confirm has exactly one
 *   fixed English title, never a variable enum with several values), so it does not belong in this
 *   file's own "one id → message table," matching the reasoning `railState.ts`'s own `UNLOCK_LADDER`
 *   already established for a fixed reason string that isn't itself a translated id.
