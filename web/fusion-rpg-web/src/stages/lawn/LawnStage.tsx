/**
 * The lawn hosted as a band-0 stage (GG-1/GG-11): `LawnPage` renders exactly
 * as it always has, and a `PanelShell` can open over it without unmounting
 * it, resetting its view model, or touching the Phaser `Game` instance
 * `LawnGameHost` owns. This is the GG-11 keystone proof (T2) — it wraps the
 * *existing* page rather than a redesigned one, on purpose, so the proof
 * holds before anything else depends on it.
 *
 * Uses `useLingui()`'s context-bound `_` with `msg` descriptors, not the
 * bare `t` macro. `t` compiles to a call against the global `i18n` singleton
 * directly — correct for non-component code, but a component using only
 * that has nothing subscribing it to `I18nProvider`'s context, so a locale
 * switch elsewhere in the tree never triggers *this* component to
 * re-render (ordinary React children-prop-reference semantics, not a
 * Lingui bug — found by trying to switch locale live and watching nothing
 * update). `_` is a real context consumer, so it does.
