 * forbids, and would break §6's own "a dial change moves the line with no FE edit" promise for this

 * recomputation of any resolved fact.
 *
 * **Never used for the committed Focus line.** `focusReading` above stays the ONLY reader of the
 * server's own already-resolved `herfindahlMilli`/`focusMilli`. This function exists solely so
 * `PlanPanel` can show "what Focus would become" while a Plan is still a draft (§5.1 item 2, §6: "it
 * moves while you edit... the player moves points between two paths and watches both halves of the
 * line move together" -- M8/GG-33, test 14). The moment a Plan commits, the next GET's real
 * `herfindahlMilli`/`focusMilli` supersede this preview entirely; it is never persisted and never
 * treated as authoritative.
 *
 * `null` when the draft owns nothing yet (mirrors `focusReading`'s own "H is undefined over an empty
 * allocation" rule) or when the blended `H` itself is exactly zero (a defensive mirror of
 * `focusReading`'s `herfindahlMilli > 0` guard — real tuning never reaches this, since at least one
 * owned node always makes `H_nodes` positive, but a preview must never divide by zero on a
