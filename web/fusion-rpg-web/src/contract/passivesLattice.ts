 * Pure derivations over `TreeResolveReport` + `PassiveTreeState.tierReqScalePoints`, mirroring the
 * shape `passivesYours.ts`/`passivesBrowse.ts` already use so `PathLattice.tsx` stays a thin render
 * layer (contractGuard.test.ts: no DTO binding and no derivation logic lives under `ui/`).
 *
 * **A real, disclosed content gap this module works around rather than hides**: no node anywhere in
 * the shared corpus has an authored player-facing name or effect sentence yet -- `tree-language`
 * (H1-H2) has not run for any shared tree (passive-tree-todo.md's own H9 status; `tree-plan`'s CLI
 * "honestly reports all 40 ... affixIds yet, since tree-language hasn't emitted them"). This is the
 * SAME gap `passivesYours.ts`'s own `NotWorkingTrait.winnerNodeId` doc comment already names ("the
 * catalog has no display-name field on the wire yet... a content gap, not something this surface can
 * fabricate a name around") -- this module renders real, structural node identity (branch/tier/node
 * id) and leaves the authored copy for the moment `tree-language` ships it.
