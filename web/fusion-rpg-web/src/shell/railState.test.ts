   * built." "Built" here is read as **routed** — a real `<Route>` in `app/routes.tsx`, so the id is
   * not dead/empty — checked directly against that file's own source rather than a second
   * hand-maintained list, so this can never silently drift from the real route table.
   *
   * This is a narrower claim than "has real playable content": information-architecture.md:188
   * separately and correctly still calls siege and delve "declared and unbuilt" in THAT sense (no
   * room graph, no siege board yet) — the two statements describe different things and are both true
   * at once. `battle` is the one id with neither: no route in app/routes.tsx at all
   * (spec-board-render.md's own decision 40 either lands `#/battle` on the shared board layer or
   * retires the id — this file does not anticipate which).
