/**
 * rift-gate first-open-signal: records the durable once-per-player fact that the FE has been opened.
 *
 * Fired once on load, keyed on the FE being opened — not on the tombstone, the embed marker, or the
 * route, so it is correct however the player arrived (menu tombstone, F10, the launcher's "Open RPG
 * UI", or a plain browser visit).
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a failed write is retried on the next load and never blocks the shell. The
 * server owns idempotency (INSERT OR IGNORE on player_id), so a repeat is a no-op.
 *
 * Trigger only — the capture program that consumes the fact is separate and is not started here.
