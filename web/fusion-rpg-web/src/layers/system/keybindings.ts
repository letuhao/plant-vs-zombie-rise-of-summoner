 * `SanctumStage.tsx` reads `currentKeyFor` instead of a hardcoded key literal, so the Controls
 * screen and the actual registered verb can never drift apart.
 *
 * The launcher's own reserved overlay-toggle key is never a bindable action here — it's
 * `keymap.ts`'s own forbidden-keys list, rendered by `SystemLayer.tsx` as a read-only reserved
 * row (plate: "reserved... owned by the game launcher"), not something this module could assign.
