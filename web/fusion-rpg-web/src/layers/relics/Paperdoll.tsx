 * surface has no render band and needs none.
 *
 * **Two frame vocabularies, both shown.** A role's name depends on the item's frame — `main-hand`
 * on a humanoid is `muzzle` on a plant — and nothing on the wire says which frame a worn item was
 * made for yet. Showing both names is the honest answer; picking one would be a guess that reads
 * as fact.
 *
 * **An empty role is a designed state, not a blank.** Each cell says which role it is even when
 * nothing fills it, because an equip screen that renders only what you own cannot show you what
 * you are missing.
