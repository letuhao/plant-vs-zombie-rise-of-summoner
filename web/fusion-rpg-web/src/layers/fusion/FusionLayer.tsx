 * T15 — the demon fusion lab (spec-demon-fusion.md), already shipped and real, now reachable
 * as a band-2 layer over whatever stage the player is on (GG-1) instead of a standalone route.
 * `FusionPage`'s own internals are unchanged — same pattern T12 used for the developer tree's
 * nine pages: the page keeps its own `<Page>` heading inside this shell's body, so the tab is
 * reachable without a rewrite of a page that already works.
