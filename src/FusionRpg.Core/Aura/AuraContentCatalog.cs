/// aura-skill T16: the twelve auras, one per aptitude, as DATA — grant channel(s), contest channel(s),
/// and the aptitude id that reads `share` for them (`AuraMagnitude.Compute`'s second axis).
///
/// <para><b>Not authored as `world-buff.*` DB containers, and that is a stated scope limit, not an
/// oversight.</b> `spec-aura-content.md` §2 itself proves a `world-buff.*` container is not read by
/// anything today — `TraitAtomSource.FromContainers` only accepts `ContainerKind.Trait`, and making a
/// `world-buff.*` row reachable through the live-lawn scope/grant pipeline
/// (`BattlefieldOwnSideReactor`/`ScopeCompatibility`) is explicitly `aura-delivery-path`'s own job, a
/// SEPARATE module the spec says this one "cannot ship before" — and `aura-delivery-path` remains
/// unspecced and deferred (this program's own earlier finding, R4/audit D5). Authoring a `world-buff.*`
/// row nobody can read would be exactly the "content-side face of D5" the spec warns against, not
/// progress. This catalog instead feeds the delivery mechanism THIS program actually built and proved
/// end to end — T12's `ActiveCommanderAura`/`BattleDerivedModifierLedger`, battle-scoped — so the
/// twelve auras are real, tested, and reachable, even though the live-lawn container path is not.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Every aura writes `.omni`</b> — settled by arithmetic, not preference
/// (`spec-aura-content.md` §4's own derivation): `CombatDerivedReader` reads `omni + element`
/// additively with weights summing to 1.0, so an omni write and an all-six-element write are
/// numerically IDENTICAL at 1/6th the authoring cost, and parry/block/reflect/crit-resist are read
/// omni-only in production — an element-slot version of those four auras would be read by nothing.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Opposition closure holds over the non-exempt set, not absolutely.</b> Two declared
/// exemptions: Retribution's `combat.reflect.resist.damage` contest channel is real but unbacked — no
/// aura grants it. Focus reverses entirely (`RelationKind.Self`, buffs the commander's own action
/// cooldowns, contests nothing) — its content is a documented gap, not a channel pair, since it does
/// not compose through this catalog's grant/contest shape at all.</para>
