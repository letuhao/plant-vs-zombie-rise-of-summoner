/// <paramref name="sourceValue"/>; <see cref="PointsFor"/> only knows the RATE. Aspect's own source
/// (`element_mastery`) is owned by the demon program's `aspect-scope` module and does not exist yet —
/// this type is agnostic to that, so it ships complete today and "lights up" for Aspect the moment a

/// conversion, so an accumulation there inverted the locked commander-smallest-to-unique-largest
/// ordering by 176× at ordinary play levels (species L12: 2,640 cumulative XP × 4 = 10,560, against
