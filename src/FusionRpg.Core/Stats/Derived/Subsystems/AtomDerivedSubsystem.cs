///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> <c>stat.derived</c> is the kind whose entire purpose is "direct
/// derived-channel mods", and an aura is exactly one. D6 quarantined it to
/// <c>None/None/None</c> in 2026-08-22 because no runtime had an executor — a bind would be accepted
/// and then do nothing, forever. E12 (2026-08-23) gave <b>battle</b> one via
/// <see cref="Battle.TraitAtomSource"/>; the lawn never got the twin. Five features
/// (patron, stars, injuries, contracts, commander aptitudes) each grew a private derived-write path
/// instead, exactly as actor-hub-ssot.md §6.1 predicted in writing.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a subsystem and not a sink arm.</b> The lawn's derived compose already runs per
/// resolve in <see cref="ActorHub.ResolveDerived"/>: every registered
/// <see cref="IActorStatSubsystem"/> contributes, <see cref="DerivedComposer"/> folds. Adding an arm
/// to <c>InjectorEffectActionSink</c> would be a second delivery path for a value the composer
/// already owns. This mirrors <see cref="AptitudeSubsystem"/>'s shape exactly — an injected
/// per-context delegate, so the module owns *resolving mods into channel values* and never owns
/// *where the bindings are stored*.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Order 350</b> is not a new band: actor-hub-ssot.md §6's registry table already reserves
/// <c>foundation.effect | 350 | session bag | future timed derived</c> for precisely this. Using the
/// reserved slot keeps the documented registry honest rather than inventing a sixth ordering.</para>
///
/// <para><c>ContributeDerived</c> is idempotent and stateless between calls, matching this seam's
/// standing contract — and <c>ActorHub.Register</c> replaces by <see cref="SubsystemId"/>, so a double
