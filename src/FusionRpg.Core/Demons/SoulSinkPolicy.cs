/// was a flat, Θ-free number: the slot price, the ritual price, upkeep, the pull cost, the fusion

/// inflation on a schedule and breaks PS-5's rule that a faucet and its sink share a scale.</para>

/// <para><b>Why it is inert today, and why it was still worth fixing now.</b> Every vanilla-PvZ
/// award reads at the pin (<c>Θ=20</c>, <c>contentScale = 1.000</c> exactly) because the capture
/// pipeline carries no per-kill depth signal yet — see <c>RpgStore.Souls.cs</c>'s
/// <c>VanillaPvzKillAndRunTheta</c> for the full reasoning. So this multiplication is
/// byte-identical at every shipped call site right now. It stops being byte-identical the moment a
/// real Θ signal lands, which is exactly when retrofitting it would be a balance change instead of
/// a no-op.</para>
