/// (2026-09-06) of the legacy, pre-anchor 84-species compiled catalog's own real, hand-authored
/// <c>TraitPool</c> arrays, taken immediately before that catalog's own T4.8-step-7 deletion — ported
/// forward verbatim for every species still present in the anchor-pipeline roster today, rather than
/// re-deriving what a human already picked once. Deliberately NOT a live read of the (now-deleted)
/// legacy catalog: this class must keep working after that catalog is gone.</para>
/// <para>2. Every other species gets a deterministic pick from a private FNV-1a hash — copied from
/// (not referenced from) the legacy <c>DemonSpeciesGenerator.Hash</c>/<c>TraitsFor</c> shape for the
/// same reason: that generator is also deleted under T4.8 step 7. Pool membership is a closed
/// vocabulary tied 1:1 to <see cref="DemonTraitCatalog"/>'s own 14 hardcoded ids (adding a trait
/// already means a code change there too), so it stays a structural constant here, not a
/// <c>data/tuning</c> file — the same reasoning the legacy generator already applied to this exact
/// data.</para>
