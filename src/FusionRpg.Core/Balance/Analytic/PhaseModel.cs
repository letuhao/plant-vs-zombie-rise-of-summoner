/// class-system-todo.md P4.3 — the shield phase boundary and the reflection gate
/// (class-analytic-balance-2026-08-25.md §6.1). Three independent pure building blocks; composing
/// them into a race is <c>Predictor</c>'s job (P4.6), not this one's.
///
/// <para><b>1. The shield phase.</b> While a shield stands, <see cref="ShieldMath.AbsorbLayer"/> takes
/// the whole hit and spends <c>damageToShield</c> from the pool, so one shield HP is worth
/// <c>input/damageToShield</c> raw incoming HP — <see cref="ShieldEffectiveHp"/> computes that ratio.
/// Because both phases (shield-active and HP-only) face the identical incoming distribution
/// (mitigation runs before the shield gate — only the target changes), the two phases' first-passage
/// times sum to exactly what one pool of size <c>hp + S_eff</c> already gives
/// (research §6.1: "One extra term, no second solve") — so the caller adds <see cref="ShieldEffectiveHp"/>
/// straight onto <c>hp</c> before calling <see cref="FirstPassage.Compute"/>; nothing here re-derives
/// first-passage math.</para>
///
/// <para><b>2. "A shield needs a grant."</b> <see cref="ShieldRuntime.Apply"/> computes
/// <c>maxHp = grant.BaseHp + capacity</c> and only ever forms a pool when some
/// <see cref="ShieldGrant"/> triggered that call — there is no shipped path where a capacity stat
/// alone spontaneously creates HP. <see cref="ShieldEffectiveHp"/> mirrors that exactly: it takes the
/// shield's already-resolved <c>maxHp</c> as an opaque parameter (never re-derives it from a capacity
/// channel) and returns 0 when it is non-positive — "no grant" and "zero effective HP" are the same
/// state here, by construction, not by a special case.</para>
///
/// <para><b>3. The reflection gate.</b> <c>CombatDamageDispatcher.cs:65-69</c>: with the shipped
/// <c>reflectReadsPostShield: true</c> (data/tuning/combat.v1.json:26 — confirmed live, not assumed),
/// the bounce reads <c>applied.AppliedAmount</c> — the amount that reached HP — so a fully-absorbed
/// hit reflects nothing. First-order treatment (research §6.1): reflection fires only during the HP
/// phase, whose share of the total expected fight is <c>hp/(hp+S_eff)</c> —
/// <see cref="ReflectionHpPhaseShare"/> computes that scale factor; <see cref="Reflect"/> computes the
/// (unscaled) bounce itself, and the caller multiplies the two together.</para>
///
/// <para><b>4. "Reflected damage is unmitigated."</b> <c>CombatDamageDispatcher.cs:81-82</c>: the
/// bounce packet carries no <c>ElementPayload</c>, so <c>OverlayCombatMath.Finalize</c> passes it
/// through unchanged. <see cref="Reflect"/> mirrors this by calling no mitigation function at all —
/// on purpose, not an oversight.</para>
