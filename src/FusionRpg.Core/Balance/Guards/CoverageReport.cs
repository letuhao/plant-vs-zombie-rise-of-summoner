/// <param name="ElementAxis">Which element axis was live. <see cref="Analytic.StrikeMixture"/>'s own
/// doc comment (P4.1) is explicit that it is omni-only ("elements are out of scope... mirrors
/// OverlayCombatCalculator's own Components.Count == 0 branch") — every corner in this guard's matrix
/// is a 1-D slice of what a live element axis would make a 2-D matchup space.</param>
/// <param name="ReservedFamilies">Channel families registered in the shipped roster/catalog with no
/// reader yet — confirmed present in `data/tuning/aptitudes.v1.json`'s own edges this session, not
/// assumed: `resource.efficiency.*` (spec-action-costs.md §1: registered, "has no reader" until A3
/// ships) and `move.range` (the action layer's own, unbuilt).
///
/// `skill.cooldown.*` / `skill.effectiveness.*` are a different case as of 2026-09-04 and are listed
/// here for a narrower reason: they DO have readers now (combat-unification `species-skills` S2/S3 —
/// `CooldownLedger.Start` and `OverlayCombatRequest.EffectivenessMultiplier`, both live on the shipped
/// basic attack), but those readers are on the BATTLE path, and this guard predicts with a closed-form
/// duel model that does not run one. So they remain reserved *for prediction* while no longer being
/// unbuilt — a distinction worth keeping, because "the predictor cannot see it" and "nothing reads it"
/// are different problems with different fixes.
