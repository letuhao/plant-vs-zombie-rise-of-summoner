        // `CooldownLedger.Start` is a plain overwrite, this call firing unconditionally after
        // `ActionRunner.TryCommit`'s own `StartsAt==Commit` arm (or before `OnRecoveryDue`'s own
        // `StartsAt==RecoveryEnd` arm) would silently re-arm at the WRONG tick the moment content ever
        // authored `StartsAt: Commit`/`RecoveryEnd` -- latent only because no shipped content does yet.
        // Gated behind `StartsAt == Resolve` (the enum's own declared default,
        // `ActionEnvelope.cs:110`), matching `ActionRunner`'s own three-way split exactly and provably
