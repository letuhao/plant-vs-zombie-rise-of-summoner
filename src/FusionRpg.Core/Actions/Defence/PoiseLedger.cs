/// T25/T26 (spec-defence-actions.md §3): `poise`'s three-part cost. A flat commit at raise, an
/// absorb drain proportional to what the guard stopped, and a per-tick hold while held — the third
/// component beyond spec-guard-economy.md's flat-commit-plus-absorb-drain, which priced guard as a
/// proc; a STANCE needs the per-tick hold specifically to satisfy the termination invariant (§2.2:
/// "no later layer can repair a pool that refills faster than it drains").
///
/// <para>A thin wrapper over T15's <see cref="ActorResourcePools.TrySpend"/> — never a second pool
/// mechanism. "A8 authors no damage math" (spec §0): <see cref="AbsorbDrainAmount"/> takes the

/// stopping it costs.</para>

/// three-part cost built under class-system P7.1–P7.3, is deleted. Its own doc justified floor-at-zero
/// commits as a PS-8 requirement: <i>"a 'cannot afford to guard' refusal would be exactly [a hard
