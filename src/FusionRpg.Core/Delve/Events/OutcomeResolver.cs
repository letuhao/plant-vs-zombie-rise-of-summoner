/// `:outcome` draw, and (2026-09-08) the forced-outcome-via-`supplyOverride` path are all built. Every
/// dropBand/weight vocabulary is a plain caller-supplied parameter, never hardcoded — `dropBand` is the
/// ITEM registry's own vocabulary (D3.1's own citation: "this module has no business owning" it), so
/// this class reads it exactly the way `EventCatalog.Load` already does. `TryInstantiate` and the
/// five-way atom-kind dispatch table are NOT built here — see D3.3/D3.5's own todo entries.
///
/// <para><b>The forced-outcome field, re-investigated 2026-09-08: no new seed-contract field is
/// needed, because the resolution rule is already written down, just never implemented.</b> The prior
/// finding ("no field anywhere records which outcome is forced") was correct about the ON-DISK seed
/// JSON — confirmed again by re-reading `EventRow.cs`/`spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md` §1.4's own field
/// table, still no such key. But `spec-event-deck.md:157-158` ("Forced outcome") says literally: *"the
/// outcome is the row `supplyOverride` designates (**the importer records the forced ordinal**...)"* —
/// naming this as an IMPORTER/resolver-computed fact, never an authored one, which is exactly what a
/// pure function does instead of a stored field. `tools/seedsmith/seedsmith/adapters/dungeon/
/// descriptions.py`'s own authoring brief for `supplyOverride` independently confirms which outcome:
/// *"to force this event's **best** outcome"* — and the ordinal vocabulary's own preference reading
/// (`good · mixed · bad · nothing`, the exact tuple order named identically in `schema.py`'s
/// `OUTCOME_ORDINAL`, `spec-dungeon-seed-contract.md`'s own field-table row, and this file's own
/// `ShiftDropBand`, where `good` moves toward stronger bands and `bad` toward weaker ones) gives "best"
/// an unambiguous, already-established total order — never a guess invented here. Spec's own worked
/// example (`spec-event-deck.md:158`, Darkest Dungeon's Iron Maiden curio, *"100% loot with Herbs"*)
/// independently confirms an override always forces a strictly POSITIVE result, matching `good` ranking
/// first. <see cref="TryForcedOutcome"/> is that resolver: it never reads or invents a stored field,
