/// `encounter-generator` D2.6 (spec-encounter-generator.md §6) — an elite (or a boss phase) is one

/// its own. `ContainerKind.Enemy` is this task's own seventh kind (`ContainerRow.cs`,
/// `ContainerValidator.cs`).
///
/// <para><b>What this module does NOT build, and why — the library gap, named as the external
/// dependency it is (§6's own words).</b> `data/seed/effects/affixes/all.json` holds exactly two
/// entries today (read in full, 2026-09-06): both plain `{id, name, class, refs}` — no `tags` field,
/// and <see cref="AffixRow"/> itself (`ContainerRow.cs:93`) carries no tag concept at all. "Pool =
/// every affix-library row tagged for enemies" (§6) is therefore not this method's own filter to run —
/// there is no tag to filter BY yet. <see cref="Apply"/> takes the already-filtered
/// <c>pool</c> as a plain parameter (the same "read model owned elsewhere" shape
/// <see cref="Encounter.Build"/>'s own anchor and corpus already are), and correctly degrades to
/// "no affix" for exactly the reason the real pool is empty today: nothing is tagged yet, so a real
/// call against the real corpus always takes the degradation path, which is proven directly below
/// rather than assumed.</para>
///
/// <para><b><c>exclusiveTags</c> needs no mechanism here either</b> (§6, verbatim) — each tag becomes
/// the <see cref="ContainerPoolRow.Group"/> of the pool rows carrying it, and the ALREADY-BUILT
/// one-per-group rule (<c>ContainerValidator.cs:33-38</c>, exercised on every
/// <see cref="Instantiator.TryInstantiate"/> call) refuses the pair. Nothing new to write.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Genuinely deferred: persisting the rolled instance for a later
/// <c>IContainerEffectResolver</c> to answer from.</b> This module is pure (§9: no store) and returns
/// the rolled <see cref="InstanceRow"/> directly; making a LATER battle bind find that SAME instance
/// (rather than re-rolling, which would silently break "reproduces over `(container, revision,
/// rollSeed, Θ_room)`" the moment anything else in the pipeline is not bit-for-bit identical) needs
/// somewhere to persist it — outside this module's own "no store" boundary, and no delve-specific
/// <c>IContainerEffectResolver</c> implementation exists anywhere in `src/` yet either. Named here
/// rather than silently assumed solved.</para>
