/// base price is <c>ContractPolicy.RitualPrice</c> (`ContractPolicy.cs:161-166`) — the already-shipped,
/// contract-specific wrapper that itself calls the SAME `SoulSinkPolicy.Price` every `DelvePrices`
/// function also wraps, so the underlying pricing engine is identical even though the call does not
/// pass through the `DelvePrices` type; only the loyalty scale on top of it is new arithmetic, and it
/// lives here rather than being re-derived ad hoc by a future caller. <see cref="Supply"/> has no
/// price to compute at all yet — it refuses, via the same <see cref="DelvePriceRules.PriceUndesigned"/>
