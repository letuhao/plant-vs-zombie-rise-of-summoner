///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>stat.modify</c> (primary) — <c>Flat | Increased | More</c> (`AtomKindRegistry.cs:517`).</item>
/// <item><c>stat.derived</c> — <c>Flat | Increased | Replace | Flag</c>. There is **no `More`** on the
/// derived side (§6 M3): `AtomDerivedSubsystem.TryParseOp` has no `<c>more</c>` arm, so a `More`-op
/// derived atom would compose to nothing. M3 is enforced by a NAMED refusal at both the catalog loader
/// and `TreeBinderRun.ParseOp` — never by the absence of this member.</item>

/// <para><b>Why `More` exists here at all (P4.2, R2).</b> The two kinds share this one enum, so a
/// member absent for the derived side was also absent for the primary side — and the language stage
/// picked `more`-op primary affixes (e.g. `atom.savagery`, `atom.arm-hardening`) on real tree nodes,
/// every one of which was refused. The member was added and the derived-side refusal moved from a
/// structural property to an explicit kind-aware check, so it stays loud instead of decaying into the
/// silent drop `TreeAtomSource.BoundAtomsFor` performs when `TryParseOp` fails. The exact node and
/// family counts are a READING of the corpus at the revision the fix landed, not a constant to quote —
/// re-run `tools/TreeBinder --check` for the current numbers.</para>
