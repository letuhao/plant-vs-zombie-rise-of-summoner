/// same affixes, same `kMicro`, same budget. The field exists only so one caller can carry a node's
/// full identity through the pipeline without a second, near-duplicate input shape; nothing in

/// <para><b><see cref="DeliberateHole"/> is `tree-plan`'s own suppression flag</b> (§7.2's
/// "consequence for tree-plan": "stage 1 owes a flag that suppresses conversion nodes at plan time,
/// so the refusal is a zero-count assertion in a healthy run rather than a per-run event"). Read
/// here, never invented by this module: when the plan already knows a slot cannot bind today (the
/// canonical case is a conversion placeholder reserved ahead of the still-unbuilt 17th atom kind,
/// D16), it flags that node. The binder still refuses it and still reports the unspent budget
/// (§7.2 item 2 — nothing is ever silently absorbed), but a flagged refusal does not by itself fail
/// the run the way a surprise refusal does (§7.2 item 3's `FAIL, not NOT_MEASURED` is for the
/// unflagged case — see <see cref="BinderRunReport.From"/>).</para>
