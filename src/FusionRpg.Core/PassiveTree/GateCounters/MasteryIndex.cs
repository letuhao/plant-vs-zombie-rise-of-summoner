/// A gate counter is an ACCUMULATION; a tier gate reads an INDEX. This is the one place the two are

/// XP into a level (<c>Progression/RpgProgression.cs:80,99</c>) — so the index is the square root of
/// the count.
///
/// <para>That is not a stylistic echo. <c>progression.v1.json</c>'s awards are paid PER EVENT
/// (<c>kill = 12</c>), so a cumulative event count and cumulative XP are the same shape by
/// construction; reusing the shape is what makes one <c>req(t)</c> threshold mean one Θ across every
/// tree category (spec-gate-counters.md §3.2). It is also not a second power ladder — it is row 6's
/// shape reading its own <c>(first, step)</c> pair, which is exactly the precedent
