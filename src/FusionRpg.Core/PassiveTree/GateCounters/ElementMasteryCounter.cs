/// <item><b>(a) Outbound, never inbound.</b> No attacker (<see cref="ElementMasteryCreditInput.AttackerPtr"/>
/// null/blank -- an attacker-less source, e.g. an environmental hazard) earns nothing. Unlike
/// <c>status_applied</c>'s (d), §2.2 names no self-target exclusion for damage -- this class implements
/// exactly the four sub-decisions §2.2 states and no more.</item>
/// <item><b>(b) Landed, never attempted, and non-zero.</b> <c>DamageApplyPipeline</c> deliberately lets
/// a zero un-absorbed delta reach the sink for miss-telemetry parity (<c>DamageApplyPipeline.cs:44-47,
/// 99-104</c>) and returns <c>FullyAbsorbed</c> separately when a shield eats the whole hit
/// (<c>:36-38,95-97</c>) -- so the credit test is <c>Outcome == Applied</c> **and**
/// <c>AppliedAmount != 0</c>, both required, neither sufficient alone.</item>
/// <item><b>(c) Each component once, never weighted.</b> A fire 0.6 / ice 0.4 packet credits fire +1
/// AND ice +1 -- <see cref="ElementPayloadComponent.Weight"/> is read for presence only (it is a
/// <c>double</c>, and CLAUDE.md forbids a float on a magnitude path) and is never multiplied into the
/// credit. Components are de-duplicated by <see cref="ElementPayloadComponent.Element"/> before
/// crediting so a payload that happened to carry the same element twice still credits it once --
/// belt-and-suspenders alongside the shipped payload shape, which is not expected to duplicate an
/// element within one packet.</item>
/// <item><b>(d) Direct hits, never DoT pulses.</b> <see cref="DamageOrigin.StatusPulse"/> earns
/// nothing -- crediting a pulse would let one applied status earn an elemental credit every tick for
/// its whole duration, double-paying for the one application <c>status_applied</c> already credited
/// (§2.2d). <b>Wiring the real pulse call site to pass <see cref="DamageOrigin.StatusPulse"/> is
/// tracked separately (G1's deferred item) -- `BattleEngine.cs`/`BattleRunState.cs` are under
/// concurrent edit by another session this task routed around, per R9. This class enforces the
/// exclusion correctly the moment the caller passes the right origin; until that one line lands at the
/// pulse site, every hit still reaches here as `DirectHit` by the enum's own default, which is the
/// same "defaulted parameter, zero lines at existing call sites" shape P1 was built for.</b></item>

/// No <c>StatusCategoryRegistry</c>-style roster validation exists here on purpose:
/// <see cref="ElementTypeId"/> is a closed six-value enum
