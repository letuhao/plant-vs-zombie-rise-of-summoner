/// and <see cref="DropEntryKind.Unique"/></b> — the only two any real, already-blocked party-dungeon
/// task needs today (an ordinary room/quest drop is Equipment; a boss first-clear relic is Unique).
/// Every other kind refuses BY NAME (`drop.mint-kind-unsupported`, naming the kind in the message) —
/// never a silent mishandle, never a guessed minting mechanic for a kind that belongs to whichever
/// program eventually builds the general dispatcher (general drop-volume/the armoury, D26, is
/// explicitly out of THIS program's own scope — `tasks/party-dungeon-plan.md` §8; confirmed by reading
/// `docs/architecture/item/spec-drop-volume.md`'s own D26 ruling directly: "the item system balances
/// items, not the game").</para>
///
/// <para><b>Traced against the real, unmodified `LootPipeline.Resolve` (not assumed):</b> today, only
/// its own `MintEquipment`/`MintUnique` inner functions ever call `view.Mint` at all — every other
/// entry kind either never reaches a grant (`Table` recurses, `Nothing` is skipped, `Insert`/`Charm`/
/// `Consumable` are refused earlier at `DropTableDraw.IsAvailable`) or is added to `manifest.Grants`
/// directly, with no instance and no `Mint` call (`Material`/`Currency`). So the seven-kind refusal
/// below is a defensive completeness property of THIS function's own public contract — its signature
/// accepts any `LootGrant` regardless of kind, matching `DelveLoot.RollRoom`'s own general
/// `Func&lt;LootGrant, int, LootMintResult&gt;` parameter shape — not a path the real pipeline can
/// reach today. Both are worth having: the pipeline's own shape today, and a `mintAt` that never
/// mishandles a kind if that shape ever changes or a caller invokes it directly.</para>
///
/// <para>Pure, no I/O — this is Core-layer by design: both `ContainerFor` (Unique) and `Equipment`
/// (the derived role-family table) are caller-supplied, exactly like every other Data-layer fact this
/// whole pipeline already reads through a delegate. The REAL, callable `mintAt` a live server plugs
/// into `RollRoom`/`RollQuestReward` composes this with a Data-layer resolver AND the one piece of
/// persistence this function itself never performs — `RpgStore.MintGrant`/`.MintGrantUnlocked` calls
/// `SaveInstanceUnlocked` on the result, never `AcquireItemUnlocked`/`PersistLootUnlocked`, which stay
/// the CALLER's own job per this session's established `Unlocked`-composition convention. That
/// composition is necessarily Data-layer, not Core: `FusionRpg.Core` carries no `ProjectReference` to
/// `FusionRpg.Data` (confirmed directly — the dependency runs the other way), so nothing in this file
/// could call `GetContainer` itself even if it wanted to.</para>
