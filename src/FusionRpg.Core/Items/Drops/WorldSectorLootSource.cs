/// <c>drop.world.sector-clear</c> table (Correction 1 calibrates it at 1.50) with no
/// <c>loot_source</c> pointing at it, because <c>sectorLevel(danger_band)</c> was recorded as owed by
/// the world program. It is not owed: <c>ssot-power-scale.md</c> §5.3/§10.3 closed it by owner
/// decision on 2026-08-23 as <c>mapLevel(M) = Wm · DangerBand(M)</c> with <c>Wm = 5</c> derived from
/// the shipped <c>SectorTypeCatalog</c>, and <c>spec-content-authoring.md</c> §2.1 (owner approved
/// 2026-08-24) names the identical formula for this exact <c>contentLevel</c> row. What was missing
/// was the code. <see cref="PowerIndexComposer.MapLevel"/> is now that code, and this file is the one
/// call site the loot lane needs — no private <c>f(level)</c> is declared here.</para>
///
/// <para>⛔ <b>The row is resolved, never authored, and that is forced by the idempotency gate.</b>
/// <c>LootCorrelation.Derive("world-sector", sourceId)</c> is <c>loot:sector:{sourceId}</c>, and the
/// pipeline keys step 1 on <c>(player_id, correlation_id)</c>. Authoring eight static rows in
/// <c>data/seed/loot/tables.v1.json</c> — one per SECTOR TYPE, the shape the other eight sources use —
/// would make every sector of a type share one correlation id, so the second <c>boss-lair</c> a player
/// cleared would replay the first and mint nothing. The sector's own id has to be the key, and a
/// sector id is generated per world, so no seed file can hold it. The danger band is live state
/// (<c>SectorState.DangerBand</c>) rather than authored content for the same reason.</para>
///
/// <para>This type stays free of <c>FusionRpg.Core.World</c> on purpose: it takes the band as an
/// <c>int</c>, so the loot lane never has to load a world to price a sector. The tests are what walk
