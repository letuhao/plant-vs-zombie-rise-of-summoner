/// I2's alias map (<c>ssot-equip-slots.md</c> §5.7 step 1, restated by
/// <c>decision-d1-durable-ownership.md</c> §10 M1): the three legacy
/// <c>rpg_unique_equipment.slot</c> strings and the canonical <see cref="ItemRole"/> each one means.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists at all.</b> Module 4's durable record is
/// <c>rpg_item_assignment(specimen_id, role, …)</c>, keyed on a canonical fifteen-value role
/// vocabulary. The shipped equipment wire — <c>GET/PUT/DELETE /api/unique/actors/{id}/equipment</c>,
/// <c>RelicDto.Slot</c>, and <c>web/…/layers/relics/RelicsLayer.tsx</c> — still speaks
/// <c>weapon|armor|trinket</c>. D1 §10 M2 is explicit that the SSOT switch keeps the
/// <b>output shape unchanged</b>, so this map is the seam: canonical roles in the table, legacy
/// labels on the wire, and exactly one place that knows both.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Structural, not tunable — deliberately not a <c>data/tuning/*.json</c> row.</b> These
/// three strings are a closed set of *already-shipped persisted values*: a balance pass can never
/// want to change what <c>"weapon"</c> historically meant in a row already written to a player's
/// database. Changing one would not retune the game, it would silently re-home saved equipment.
/// That is the <c>tunables-ssot.md</c> "changing it breaks whether the system works rather than how
/// the game feels" test, answered on the structural side.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Closed and one-way-widening.</b> Widening the wire to the full fifteen roles is D1 §10's
/// <b>M3</b>, a separate step that changes the REST payload and the FE literal. Until then
/// <see cref="TryFromLegacy"/> is the only door: a caller handing in a canonical role id that is not
/// one of these three is refused, rather than being quietly accepted into a wire the FE cannot
/// render.</para>
