/// simulator, and the invariant belongs to the ladder this module seeds, not to any downstream lane.
///
/// All three variances act, at the precision the shipped schema allows: count uses the seeded FLOOR
/// only (`prefix_rolls + suffix_rolls`), never the true range, because `pool_rolls_max` does not exist
/// on the shipped schema yet (an ask-first, not decided — see `data/seed/rarity/README.md`). Using the
/// floor is the documented fallback (§5.3) and understates count separation, never overstates it.
/// Dropping count instead of flooring it is not a smaller version of the same measurement: two
/// `window`-step rungs share an identical tier window by design (`grafted`/`cultivated`,
/// `fused`/`chimeric`, `heirloom`/`firstseed`, `sunwoven`/`almanac`), so a two-variance model collapses
/// each of those pairs to a coin flip and the pooled invariant fails outright -- measured, not assumed.
///
/// Single channel family on purpose (SC4 forbids cross-family totals): every draw is `vitality`
