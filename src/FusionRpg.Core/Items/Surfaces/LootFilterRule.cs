/// <c>40/day</c> line is I12 asking for <i>a loot filter — an interface requirement, not a cap</i>.
/// Every method here takes an already-materialised row list and returns a subset of it. There is no
/// path from this file to generation: it references no drop table, no pipeline, no pity counter and
/// no store, and a guard test asserts exactly that by reading its own source. <b>Hiding a row changes

/// it has no parameter that could carry one.</para>
