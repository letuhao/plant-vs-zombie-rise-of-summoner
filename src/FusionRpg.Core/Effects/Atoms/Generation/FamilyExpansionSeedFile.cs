/// The ONE canonical serializer for E43's generated atom-seed files (spec-family-expand.md §3.2).
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists as shared code rather than a local helper in the tool.</b> The generator
/// writes these files and the test suite verifies them; when each side owned its own serializer they
/// could — and did — disagree. Three committed files drifted from their sources for a full commit
/// cycle (tasks/passive-tree-repair-plan.md P1.1): two carried a stale authored <c>name</c> after a
/// family rename, and one differed on a single line ending. The id-only comparison the test used
/// could see neither, because a rename keeps every id and a newline keeps every byte except one.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The line-ending contract.</b> <c>JsonSerializer</c>'s <c>WriteIndented</c> output
/// separates lines with <c>Environment.NewLine</c> — CRLF on Windows, LF elsewhere — so the same
/// content produced a different byte stream per platform. Normalising to LF here (and comparing
/// through <see cref="Canonicalize"/> in <c>--check</c>) makes the committed tree reproducible on any
/// machine, matching <c>seedsmith...plan.emit.canonical_json_bytes</c>'s contract for the committed
/// passive-tree plan: LF, UTF-8 with no BOM, trailing newline.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Writing bytes, never text.</b> Callers must use <see cref="WriteCanonical"/> (or
/// <see cref="Canonicalize"/>) rather than a text API: a default <c>File.WriteAllText</c> /
/// <c>Path.write_text</c> re-translates <c>\n</c> back to the platform separator on write, which is
/// exactly how the mixed-ending file appeared in the first place. A working tree is also subject to
/// <c>core.autocrlf</c>, so a reader must canonicalize BEFORE comparing — never assert the absence of
/// CRLF, which is an environment property, not a content one.</para>
