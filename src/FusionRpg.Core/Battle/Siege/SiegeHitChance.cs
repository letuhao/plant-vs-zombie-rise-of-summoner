/// base-defense `siege-ai` (spec-siege-ai.md, R1): a real, reusable hit-chance estimate for
/// `AiCandidate.HitChanceMilli` — the FIRST of 17.4's own four named blockers, closed by reading
/// `OverlayCombatCalculator.Compute`'s own already-shipped Omni fallback path
/// (`Combat/OverlayCombatCalculator.cs:117-119`) rather than inventing a second formula. **A new,
/// additive function, never a modification to that resolver** — `OverlayCombatCalculator` stays
/// untouched, so every existing combat golden is provably unaffected by this file's own existence.
///
/// <para><b>Omni-only, deliberately</b> — not per-element. `OverlayCombatCalculator`'s own per-element
/// path additionally weighs each `ElementPayloadComponent`, which needs to know the SPECIFIC action
/// about to be used; a targeting decision (which enemy to attack, not yet which attack) does not have
/// one yet. The Omni channels (`CombatAccuracyOmni`/`CombatDodgeOmni`) are exactly the values that
/// path ALSO falls back to when a caller supplies no components (`OverlayCombatCalculator.cs`'s own
/// "empty component list is a resolver-level fallback" comment) — the same default every other
/// omni-scoped caller in this codebase already accepts, not a new approximation invented here.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The double stays inside this function.</b> `CombatProbability.Sigmoid` returns a
/// `double` (0..1) — converted to an `int` per-mille and rounded ONCE, immediately, before crossing
/// back into `AiScoring`'s own integer-only, source-scan-enforced world (R5: "no non-integer numeric
/// type anywhere in this file's arithmetic" — that rule is about `SiegeAi.cs`, and stays true because
/// the boundary is exactly here, not smeared across both files).</para>
