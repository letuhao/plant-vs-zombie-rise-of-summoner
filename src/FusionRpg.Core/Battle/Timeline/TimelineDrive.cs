/// <para><b>Backpressure is the rule that is new here.</b> The event pipeline may let a backlog grow
/// and drop droppable kinds; this drive may not, because a dropped shield expiry or DoT pulse is a
/// correctness bug rather than a lost telemetry row. Instead <b>the clock does not advance while a
/// backlog exists</b> — simulated time slows, ordering is untouched, and nothing is discarded. Offered
