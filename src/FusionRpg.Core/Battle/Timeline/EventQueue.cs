/// "Indexed" is the load-bearing word. Alongside the heap it keeps <c>seq → heap position</c>,
/// maintained by every swap, which is the standard structure for a scheduler that must cancel and
/// re-time events (the same shape as a decrease-key priority queue). It gives:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>Schedule</c> / <c>PopDue</c> / <c>Cancel</c> / <c>Reschedule</c> all O(log n).</item>
/// <item>Heap size exactly equals live event count — nothing accumulates.</item>
/// <item><c>Count</c> is simply the heap's length, so it cannot drift out of step.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// The first draft used lazy deletion instead: reschedule pushed a <i>duplicate</i> entry and
/// marked the old one stale. That was the wrong pattern here — it made re-timing O(n) per call
/// with permanent heap growth (measured: 12 000 reschedules over 200 live events left a 12 200-entry
/// heap), and it required a whole staleness apparatus whose subtlest case was two live-looking
/// copies that could only be told apart by retiring the id on fire. Maintaining the index removes
/// the cost *and* deletes that entire correctness class: there are no duplicates to distinguish.
///
/// <b>Single-threaded by design.</b> No locking, and <see cref="ComparisonCount"/> is a plain
/// increment. Every consumer is expected to be one owner on one thread — a battle resolving
/// server-side, or the Unity main thread. Sharing one queue across threads would corrupt both the
/// heap and the index map, and the fix would be an owner, not a lock.
///
/// Ordering rules that byte-identical replay depends on:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Total order is <c>(DueTick, Seq)</c>; <c>Seq</c> is unique, so ties never arise between
/// distinct events and the heap need not be stable.</item>
/// <item><c>Reschedule</c> <b>preserves</b> <c>Seq</c> — re-timing must not reorder unrelated events.</item>
