/// a Cold-plane `player_id` read that does not exist anywhere in Core today
/// (buff-debuff-scope-ideal.md §4.1/§2.3, confirmed by direct search — no such read path exists). That
/// half is `buff-debuff-scope-todo.md:249-250`'s own named, separate, unscoped gap — a larger,
/// standalone bridge for the demon program, not something this task silently half-builds. This oracle
/// answers correctly for every entity that IS mechanical (every plant and zombie on a lawn run,
/// mind-controlled or not) and is honest about not answering the specimen-ownership question at all.
