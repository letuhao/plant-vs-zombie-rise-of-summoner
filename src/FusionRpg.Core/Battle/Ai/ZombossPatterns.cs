/// <summary>
/// class-system-todo.md P7.5 — the nine named Zomboss builds (spec-zomboss-patterns.md, read in full
/// this session). Copies <see cref="World.Ai.FactionPolicies"/>'s own shape and its own stated
/// rationale exactly (§4): "Throws rather than returning null. A null would read as 'this Zomboss has
/// no build', which is indistinguishable from the human — and a typo would then look like a design
/// decision for the rest of the campaign." Code is the load source, matching
/// <c>AptitudeCatalog</c>/<c>roster.json</c>'s own precedent — `data/seed/zomboss/patterns.json` is a
/// checked-in MIRROR for tooling that cannot reference this assembly, not the source of truth
/// (tunables-ssot.md §7.2: Core reads no file).
///
/// <para><b>Nine = 3 pure + 6 mixed</b> (§3). The 3 pure share compositions are ported verbatim from
/// `tools/CombatSim/builds/{force,finesse,bastion}.json` — this program's own already-measured
/// archetype shares (read-only; `tools/CombatSim` is under separate, concurrent development this
/// session, so nothing there was edited), converted from the tool's own double shares to permille
/// `long`s (CLAUDE.md: never a `double` on a magnitude-adjacent path). The 6 mixed patterns are three
/// valid (defence-posture, breaks-posture) pairs from §3's own table — the ONLY three that are not
/// self-cancelling, verified against the roster's own counter-cycle (`data/seed/aptitudes/roster.json`'s
/// "role" column: Onslaught breaks Bulwark+Retribution, so FORCE counters BASTION; Pierce breaks
/// Fortitude+Vigor, so FINESSE counters FORCE; Precision+Ferocity break Agility+Composure, so BASTION
/// counters FINESSE) — each pair gets a guard-leaning (60/40) and an aggro-leaning (40/60) variant,
/// six total, symmetric across all three pairs.</para>
