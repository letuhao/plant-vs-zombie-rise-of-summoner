/// each loop the whole board to find one actor's `(side, typeId)` — <b>on every hit</b>, which the

/// path rather than adding a second one beside it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>A pointer is match-scoped.</b> A later match can hand the same Unity pointer to a different

///
/// <para><b>The full trigger set (DESIGN-GATE §2.16).</b> This cache is edge-refreshed, so every edge
/// that can change what a ptr's <c>(side, elements)</c> resolves to must be enumerated and tested, not
/// just the one that prompted the fix. There are exactly four candidates and only two of them fire:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>Match change</b> — fires. Handled by the wholesale clear in <see cref="Resolve"/>.</item>
/// <item><b>Hypno / charm</b> — <b>does not fire.</b> The <c>side</c> this cache stores is the actor's
/// OBJECT KIND, not its allegiance: <c>InjectorEntityRegistry.CollectSnaps</c> writes
/// <c>Side = "plant"</c> / <c>Side = "zombie"</c> as literals per collection and carries mind control in
/// the separate <c>BoardEntitySnap.MindControlled</c> flag, which <c>MechanicalOwnSideOracle</c> is the
/// SSOT for folding in ("mind control flips which side an entity fights FOR, not which side it visually
/// belongs to"). A hypnotised zombie is still a Zombie with a zombie type id, so its species row is
/// still the zombie one — flipping this cached side on hypno would make the
/// <c>(side, gameTypeId)</c> lookup MISS and degrade a charmed zombie to Neutral, and would break
/// <c>GateCounterHost</c>, which depends on this value being spawn kind (spec-gate-counters.md §2.1's
/// charm/hypno closing rule).</item>
/// <item><b>Entity death + IL2CPP pointer reuse</b> — fires, and is what
/// <see cref="Invalidate"/> exists for. A new entity allocated at a dead one's address inside the same
/// match must not inherit its entry. <c>GameHooks.ForgetEntity</c> is the single leave-board cleanup
/// every death path already funnels through, so the invalidation rides there.</item>
/// <item><b>Catalog revision mid-run</b> — <b>does not fire.</b> The index is built once from
/// <c>CreatureSpeciesCatalog</c>, which is configured exactly once per host at startup
/// (<c>SpeciesSnapshot</c>: "loaded once, immutable for the process lifetime... no live reload").
/// <c>reforge-world</c> re-rolls a PLAYER's rolled species rows in the store and never calls

/// <para><b>A fifth case, added 2026-09-14 (lawn-combat-wire T10/T12 live-inert investigation): the

/// <c>Found</c> flag instead of overloading <c>typeId == 0</c> as a "no entity" sentinel.
/// <b>2026-09-14, corrected same day (live-inert root cause, third defect):</b> the original version of

/// belief that <c>0</c> is this codebase's universal "no entity" sentinel (mirroring
/// <c>ZombieType.Nothing</c>). That belief is false for THIS game build: live evidence
/// (<c>data/generated/creatures/Peashooter.json</c> and <c>NormalZombie.json</c>, both
/// <c>"gameTypeId": 0</c>; confirmed via `debug.spawn.plant`/`debug.spawn.zombie` events showing
/// <c>type:0, typeName:"Peashooter"</c> / <c>typeName:"NormalZombie"</c> — the two most common default
/// test subjects) proves species index <c>0</c> is a real, ordinary creature on both sides, not a sentinel.
/// The old <c>typeId == 0</c> check therefore treated EVERY Peashooter and EVERY NormalZombie as
/// permanently unresolved — never a one-frame race, an unconditional miss — which is why
/// <c>LawnBasicAttackGrantBinder</c>'s own retry-and-requeue fix (same investigation, earlier the same
/// day) never closed the live symptom: retrying a board-fact lookup that is wrong by construction just
/// repeats the same wrong answer. It also silently degraded <c>InjectorCombatBridge</c>/
/// <c>InjectorStatusBridge</c>'s elemental combat math to Neutral for both species, a wider blast radius
/// than the grant binder alone. The fix is a real found/not-found signal, decoupled from the numeric
/// typeId: a board miss (<c>Found == false</c>) is answered directly and never cached, for the same
/// reason as before — a caller that retries the SAME ptr once the board genuinely knows about it must
/// not read back a stale cached Neutral, because a cache hit never re-invokes
/// <paramref name="boardLookup"/> at all.</para>
