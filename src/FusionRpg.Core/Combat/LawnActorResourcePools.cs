/// session-scoped <c>CommanderId</c> actors. Wraps the same already-shipped

/// qi, poise) rather than a second implementation; the only thing this type owns is WHICH pool
/// instance belongs to which lawn actor.

/// <para><b>Keyed by combat ptr, not commander id.</b> A lawn actor has no <c>CommanderId</c> — every
/// other Injector-side lookup for a live match (<c>InjectorEntityRegistry.FindZombie</c>/
