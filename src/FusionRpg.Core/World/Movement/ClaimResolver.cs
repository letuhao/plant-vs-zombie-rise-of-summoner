/// Taking ground (spec-world-movement.md §Claiming). A sector falls when nothing hostile stands in

///
/// Claims settle at the end of the turn, after movement and sieges, because all three of the things
/// a claim depends on — who is standing where, who is still alive, and which guards are left — are
/// decided by then. There is no separate tie-break between rival claims: two hostile forces in one
/// sector each block the other, and the battle they are already in is what decides it.
