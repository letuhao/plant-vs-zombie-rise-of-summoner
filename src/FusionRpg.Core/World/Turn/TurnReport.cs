/// the state projection spends its whole existence closing. `Detail` is free text — filtering a
/// sector name out of prose works until somebody writes a different sentence — so anything that
/// happened *somewhere* names where, structurally.
///
/// Null means "nowhere in particular": a calendar tick, or a command refused before it named ground.
/// Those are shown to everyone, because they reveal nothing about the map.
///
/// <paramref name="Audience"/> is the other half of who may see a line (world-stage W12, fog defect
/// A): a faction-scoped line that names no ground — a handicap notice, a legion topping up its
/// supply — still needs to reach only the faction it is about, not "nowhere in particular" read as
/// "everyone". Null on every line built before this field existed, which reads as "no restriction",
/// exactly the behaviour those rows already had.
