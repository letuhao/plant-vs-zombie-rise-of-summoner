/// Ordering is <c>(TimeMilli, EntityId)</c> — deliberately the entity id and not an insertion
/// sequence, so re-ordering a seeding loop can never silently change a turn's outcome. That is the
/// one difference from <c>Battle.Timeline.EventQueue</c>, which serves the combat clock and ties by
/// insertion because it also supports cancel and reschedule. Two small queues with explicit,
/// different contracts beat one shared queue that quietly means different things to each caller.
///
/// The queue is monotonic: nothing may be scheduled before the moment being processed. An out-of-
/// order insert would reorder a turn without any test noticing, so it throws instead.
