/// base-defense `siege-engagement` (module 20, spec-siege-engagement.md), decision 24: a siege is a
/// multi-turn loop — one map turn resolves one "engagement" (a district assault), and the siege
/// continues across turns until the Core falls or the assault breaks. This module adds the vocabulary
/// for "the engagement ended inconclusively and that is normal" plus a derived, never-stored
/// "is this sector under siege" predicate — deliberately reusing what already ships rather than
/// inventing either.
///
/// <para><b>Real, named, un-started gap this module does NOT fix</b>: decision 24's own core mechanic
/// — "a siege spans turns because engagements repeat" — does not actually work end to end today.
/// `DistrictAssaultPhase.Run` only ever fires for an explicit `WorldCommandKinds.Assault` command
/// (`DistrictAssaultPhase.cs:33`); a continuing siege with no fresh order every turn instead falls to
/// `ContactResolver.SectorContacts` (`World/Movement/MovementPhase.cs`), which unconditionally builds a
/// `BattleKinds.Sector` request for any two hostile forces sharing a sector — never `BattleKinds.District`
/// — confirmed by reading that file directly. `DistrictAssaultResolver`'s own delegation guard then
/// correctly (per its own contract) sends that Sector-kind request straight to
/// `PlaceholderBattleResolver`, so a second-and-later turn of the same siege silently resolves as an
/// ordinary open-field placeholder fight instead of continuing on the real board. Fixing this needs
/// `MovementPhase`/`ContactResolver` to detect an ongoing district siege (via <see cref="IsUnderSiege"/>
/// below) and emit `BattleKinds.District` with a real `BoardProjection` instead — a design call that
/// touches a phase neither this module nor `siege-resolver`'s own task list currently names, and is
/// named here rather than guessed at under time pressure.</para>
