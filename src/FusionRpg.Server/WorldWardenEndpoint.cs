/// <summary>
/// world-stage W29: the first production caller of <see cref="RpgStore.BindAsWarden"/>
/// (`RpgStore.Contracts.cs:283`). `FusionRpg.Core.csproj` declares exactly one `ProjectReference` —
/// `FusionRpg.Contracts` — so Core cannot call it; the orchestration lives here, in the Server layer,
/// which references both `FusionRpg.Core` and `FusionRpg.Data`.
///
/// Two steps, and there is no rollback between them:
///   1. `store.BindAsWarden(playerId, instanceId)` — the demon-contract side: capacity, the soul fee,
///      and the non-releasable flag are all shipped and read as-is (`RpgStore.Contracts.cs:310-323`).
///   2. `store.SubmitWorldCommands(worldId, [bind-warden])` — the ordinary world command path.
///
/// **Accepted risk, stated rather than engineered around: if step 2 fails, step 1 is not rolled
/// back.** The player has paid the soul fee and holds a non-releasable binding with no sector
/// attached. There is no cross-store transaction to reach for — the contract lives in the player
/// database and the order lives in the world's command log — and inventing a distributed rollback
/// for a single-player local server is a worse trade than the failure it prevents.
///
/// **What makes it tolerable is that step 1 is idempotent.** `BindAsWarden` returns `("replay",
/// existing)` for an instance already bound as a warden (`RpgStore.Contracts.cs:301-305`), and this
/// endpoint's own `CommandId` is derived from the instance id, so a retry of the *whole call* re-hits
/// both idempotent paths — it never double-charges the soul fee and never double-files the order.
/// The correct client response to any failure here is exactly that: retry the whole call.
