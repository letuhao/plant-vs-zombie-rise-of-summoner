/// D5.11's live-push wave (2026-09-08) — the wire vocabulary for a live delve-room fight, designed as a
/// direct, cited mapping onto <c>session.ts</c>'s own <c>SessionEvent</c> union
/// (<c>web/fusion-rpg-web/src/stages/delve/session.ts</c>) rather than a parallel one:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description><see cref="Declared"/> → <c>{type:"declared", source}</c>, <c>source</c> reusing
/// <c>DecisionSource</c>'s own two members verbatim ("player"/"timeout"), matching that file's own doc
/// comment ("mirrors DecisionSource... not a client invention").</description></item>
/// <item><description><see cref="Frozen"/> → <c>{type:"connection-dropped"}</c>. Every freeze cause —
/// three consecutive timeouts, an explicit steer-away, or a genuinely dropped connection — lands on the
/// identical <c>status:"frozen"</c> terminal state; the reducer has no separate variant per cause, so
/// this one push covers all three. The three-timeout cause is ALSO independently derivable client-side
/// by counting `Declared{source:"timeout"}` pushes (mirroring `LiveFreezeTrigger` exactly) — pushing
/// this event too for that same cause is a harmless, idempotent duplicate
/// (`sessionReducer`'s own `"connection-dropped"` case is unconditional), not a bug.</description></item>
/// <item><description><see cref="Resumed"/> → <c>{type:"resumed", replayCount}</c> and
/// <see cref="ReplayConsumed"/> → <c>{type:"replay-consumed"}</c>, pushed together by
/// <see cref="DelveBattleSessionManager"/> at the moment a session (re)starts over a persisted trace:
/// <c>replayCount</c> new <c>ReplayConsumed</c> pushes fire in the same call, immediately, rather than
/// synchronized to each individual replayed decision inside <c>InteractiveIntentSource.Replay</c> (which
/// exposes no such hook, and — deliberately, per <c>DecisionSource.Timeout</c>'s own doc comment — replay
/// is never re-timed, so there is no wall-clock moment worth waiting for between them). The whole prefix
/// length is known upfront from the trace itself, so this is an honest, complete signal, not an
/// approximation.</description></item>
/// <item><description><see cref="TurnStarted"/> is deliberately NOT one of <c>session.ts</c>'s existing
/// variants — whose turn it is does not change that reducer's own
/// status/consecutiveTimeouts/replayRemaining — it is new information a future live-input consumer needs
/// to accept a <c>Declare</c> call and render the dwell countdown.</description></item>
