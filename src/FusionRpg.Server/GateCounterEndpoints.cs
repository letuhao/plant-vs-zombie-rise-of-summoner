/// passive-tree-todo.md G6 — spec-gate-counters.md §10, §15 criterion 9: "the counters are invisible
/// without a read path, and `tree-surface` needs one." Copies `AptitudeEndpoints.cs`'s own
/// GET-state/POST-write shape rather than inventing a second one — the todo names that file (and
/// `PassiveTreeEndpoints.cs`) as the pattern this module follows.
///
/// <para><b>Why no allocation-style broadcast on POST.</b> `AptitudeEndpoints`/`PassiveTreeEndpoints`
/// broadcast because a POST there is a player action the web UI and the injector both need to reflect
/// immediately. A gate-counter credit is the opposite shape — a periodic, host-scheduled flush of
/// background progress (§4.3: "a lost window costs a little progress, never correctness"), not a
/// player-visible state change with a UI waiting on it. `tree-surface` reads the GET on its own refresh
/// cadence, the same way it already re-polls for anything else that isn't pushed.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The credit body's shape.</b> §10's project-structure row describes this endpoint as taking
/// "the batched flush ( `GateCounterAccumulator.DrainAndClear()` output shape,
/// `IReadOnlyDictionary&lt;GateCounterKey, long&gt;` )". A `GateCounterKey` is JSON-unfriendly as a
/// dictionary key (it is a 4-tuple), so the wire shape is the flattened list this file's own
/// <see cref="GateCounterCreditEntryDto"/> declares — one entry per key, each carrying all four identity
/// fields plus its delta. This also means one request can batch credits for more than one owner, which
/// <see cref="GateCounterAccumulator"/> itself never assumes (§4.3: "keyed (ownerKey, quantity,
/// subjectId)") but the store (`RpgStore.FlushGateCounters`) already accepts happily — a fresher host
/// (a future multi-actor accumulator) costs this endpoint nothing to support.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Subject-id validation, deliberately loose on POST.</b> `StatusCategoryRegistry.Register` can
/// add ids at runtime (§2.1's closing paragraph) in the INJECTOR process, which this SERVER process does
/// not necessarily share at any given moment — the server and the injector are separate processes
/// (AGENTS.md's module table). Rejecting an unrecognised `subjectId` here would make the server the
/// place a legitimate future status id silently stops crediting. `RpgStore.FlushGateCounters` already
/// treats `subject_id` as an opaque TEXT column (§4.1: "raw counts only... inputs only"), so this
/// endpoint validates structure (non-blank fields, a known `quantity` family, a positive delta) and
/// leaves subject-id membership to whichever process actually knows the roster.</para>
