/// lawn-combat-wire T10/T12's shared kill switch (lawn-combat-wire-plan.md "Kill-switch env var name":
/// fixed here so both tasks agree). Disables grant-binding (T10) AND cost-charging (T12) together —
/// with it off, the lawn is byte-identical to today: no actor ever holds an `OnDamageDealt` grant, so
/// `EffectRuntime.HasOnDamageDealtGrant()` stays false exactly as it is without this feature at all.
///
/// <para><b>Default OFF — owner decision 2026-09-15 (lawn-combat-wire L-N1).</b> T13's 300-zombie wave
/// breached the frame budget with the feature on; the owner chose "ship behind the switch, default off"
/// until a measured perf pass clears it. The env var decides first and is read once at process start:
/// <c>"0"</c> forces off, <c>"1"</c> forces on (the only way a live proof may enable it — a mid-match debug
/// toggle leaves already-bound grants live, L-N8). With the env var unset, an explicit debug/QA toggle
/// may override the default.</para>
///
/// <para><b>2026-09-14 correction (lawn-combat-wire T10/T12 live-inert investigation):</b> this used to
/// read <c>CheatState.On(CheatToggleId)</c> directly, borrowing <c>CheatSchema.EffectiveToggle</c>'s
/// own default-true fallback as this flag's ONLY source of "on by default." That is a boundary defect,
/// not a bug in <c>CheatState</c> — that class's own doc comment names its real, narrower job:
/// "Session cheat registry keyed by coverage ids from cheat-menu-coverage.md," an ephemeral debug/QA
/// toggle store. It never promised to be a durable, always-correct production feature-flag source, and
/// nothing about its contract guarantees a fresh/rehydrated/reset session reaches combat still reading
/// the fallback the way a real flag must. A real always-on-by-default production switch cannot borrow
/// its default from a system whose own contract does not promise one — the SOLID-boundary hard rule
/// this repo's CLAUDE.md states ("depend on registered abstractions, not a mode-local concrete
/// composer," the identical shape one level down). <see cref="DefaultEnabled"/> below is now this module's
/// OWN default, read first; <c>CheatState</c> is consulted only as an OPTIONAL, EXPLICIT debug/QA
/// override — never as the thing that decides what "default" means. <c>OVERLAY-COMBAT</c> (this
/// class's own sibling, referenced above) has the identical shape and is left alone here — same-class
