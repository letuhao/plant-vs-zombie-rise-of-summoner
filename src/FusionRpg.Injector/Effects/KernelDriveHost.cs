///
/// <para><b>This file is an adapter and deliberately nothing else.</b> All the logic worth testing
/// lives in <see cref="TimelineDrive"/> in Core, because CI runs ten test projects and never builds
/// <c>src/FusionRpg.Injector</c> — anything placed here is untested by CI forever. What is left is
/// what only the injector can do: read Unity's frame delta, own the board lifecycle, and name a real
/// clock.</para>
///
/// <para><b>One kernel per board</b> (owner decision, 2026-08-31): created at <c>board.start</c>, torn
/// down at <c>board.end</c>. Nothing shipped needs a timeline that outlives a board, so this is the
/// cheap default rather than a researched conclusion — and it means a stale queue can never survive
/// into the next match.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The clock is FULLY SCALED</b> (owner decision, 2026-09-04, reversing 2026-08-31) — it
/// follows <c>Time.timeScale</c>, so it stops on pause <b>and accelerates on fast-forward</b>.
/// ⛔ <b>The acceleration is chosen, not overlooked.</b> <c>CheatActions.cs:28</c> allows up to
/// <b>10×</b>, and <c>event-pipeline-v2-ssot.md</c> records that unscaled was originally picked
/// precisely so game speed could not multiply DoTs. The owner was shown that consequence and
/// confirmed it. <b>Do not "fix" a 10× DoT as a bug</b> — see <c>decisions.md</c>, <i>Battle engine
/// open questions (2026-09-04)</i>, item (4). This is why the substitution is <i>not</i>
/// byte-identical to the two grids it replaces, and why B26 is the program's one golden-mover.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Scope of that decision is this host only</b> (item (5)). Core has no
/// <c>Time.timeScale</c> and <see cref="SimulationClock"/> cannot read a wall clock at all, so battle
/// and expedition resolution stay virtual-time and instantaneous. The two clocks are separate on
/// purpose.</para>
///
/// <para>B25 builds the drive; <b>B26</b> moves the shield and DoT grids onto it. Until then the queue
/// is empty and a tick costs a clock advance and a <c>PeekDueTick</c> — which is the point of landing
/// it separately: the drive gets to be provably harmless before it carries anything.</para>
