/// <see cref="CostLedger"/>/<see cref="LawnBasicAttackCostGate"/> types battle uses, wired for the
/// injector's own actor-resolution and clock. Never a second cost authority (`guard-actor-hub.ps1`).
///
/// <para><b>Where <see cref="CostLedger"/> is called on the lawn, and its position relative to the
/// swing dedupe (spec's own explicit ask):</b> from <c>EffectRuntime.OnDrained</c>, via
/// <see cref="ShouldApplyRider"/> — called on EVERY drained <c>OnDamageDealt</c> record, strictly
/// AFTER `lawn-hit-entry`'s (T9) swing dedupe has already run (that dedupe lives in
/// <c>EventDrain.Drain</c>/<c>ConsumeSwingTriggerAndRelease</c>, which stamps
/// <see cref="EffectEventDto.IsFirstOfSwing"/> before the record ever reaches the drain callback this
/// class hooks into). This class never recomputes swing identity — it only reads the already-resolved
/// flag, so a multi-victim swing cannot be double-charged (only the first record's call reaches
/// <see cref="CostLedger.TryPay"/> at all — see <see cref="LawnBasicAttackCostGate"/>) and a genuinely
/// new swing is never skipped (a fresh <c>swingId</c> always charges on its own first-of-swing
/// record).</para>
///
/// <para><b>The lawn clock:</b> <see cref="NowTick"/> is <c>KernelDriveHost.NowTicks / 100</c> — one
/// lawn "tick" is 100 milliseconds of SIMULATED (scaled, pause-respecting) time, the SAME unit
/// <see cref="FusionRpg.Core.Battle.BattleModels.BaseResourceRegen"/> already assumes
/// (<c>TicksPerSecond = 10</c>, that method's own doc). <c>KernelDriveHost.NowTicks</c> freezes at
/// <c>Time.timeScale == 0</c> (`KernelDriveHost.Tick`'s own pause guard: `if (!(scaledDeltaTime &gt;
/// 0f)) return;`), so regen accrues on this grid and does NOT run while paused — inherited for free
/// from that already-shipped clock, with no separate pause check needed here.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Lawn pool lifecycle (spec's own "state it, do not inherit it"):</b> match-scoped and full
/// at spawn — <see cref="InjectorEntityRegistry.ResourcePools"/> creates each ptr's pool the first
/// time it is touched (<see cref="LawnActorResourcePools.GetOrCreate"/>, always via
/// <c>ActorResourcePools.CreateFull</c>) and drops it on death/board-clear
/// (<c>InjectorEntityRegistry.Remove</c>/<c>Clear</c>). This matches <c>resource-hub-ssot.md</c>'s
/// "persist across a run, refill at rest" ONLY in the sense that a run here IS one match — there is no
