/// (spec-gate-counters.md §2, §4.3, §7). Everything G1-G5 built (<see cref="StatusAppliedCounter"/>,
/// <see cref="ElementMasteryCounter"/>, <see cref="GateCounterAccumulator"/>) takes its dependencies as
/// delegates specifically so this file — the one place allowed to know about the live game — can supply
/// them without either counter ever referencing Unity or the DAL boundary
/// (<see cref="StatusAppliedSource"/>'s own doc comment: "the composition root wires the real closure").
///
/// <para><b>Ownership resolution — spawn-time roster, never current allegiance (§2.1's closing rule).</b>
/// <see cref="LawnElementResolverHost.Resolve"/> already answers "is this ptr a plant or a zombie" from
/// the actor's own OBJECT KIND (the shared board-scan cache both combat bridges already read), which is
/// invariant under a charm/hypno status — those flip which side a ZOMBIE currently fights for; they do
/// not turn it into a Plant. That is exactly the property the spec's charm/hypno closing rule needs:
/// crediting reads spawn kind, never "which team is this unit helping right now." A ptr this host cannot
/// resolve (torn-down, or off the tracked board) answers no owner, never a guessed one.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Single player, by construction.</b> Every plant-side actor is credited to
/// <see cref="CheatState.CurrentPlayerId"/> — the one player this lawn overlay ever tracks (there is no
/// PvP in this game). A zombie-side actor (charmed or not) is never credited, matching §2.1(a)/(d) and
