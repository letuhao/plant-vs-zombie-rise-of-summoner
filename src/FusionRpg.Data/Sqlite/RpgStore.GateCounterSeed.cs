/// passive-tree-todo.md G5 — D43 / spec-gate-counters.md §16 OQ1's one-time, auditable, stamped seed
/// for an EXISTING save. Orchestration only: the actual proxy math lives in
/// <see cref="ExistingSaveSeed.SeededCount"/> (Core, no DAL dependency); this file's own job is the
/// three things Core cannot do — read `rpg_aptitude_allocation` for the proxy signal, check/write the
/// one-time stamp, and write the seeded `rpg_gate_counter` rows, all inside one transaction.
///
/// <para><b>Deliberately NOT in <see cref="GateCounterBoundaryGuardTests"/>'s scanned file list</b> —
/// unlike the ongoing gate-quantity READ path (§5.1, which D35 keeps out of <c>AllocationScope</c> for
/// good, because entering it there would make a counter a fifth allocation-scope member), this is a
/// one-time MIGRATION that reads the player's own EXISTING primary-tree investment —
/// <c>rpg_aptitude_allocation</c>'s Commander-scope total — as the proxy D43 explicitly calls for
/// ("derived from something already persisted"). Reading an allocation to derive a seed value is not
/// the thing §14 forbids ("write an <c>AptitudeAllocation</c> row FROM a counter") — this file never
/// writes one, only reads one, and only into a completely separate table
/// (<c>rpg_gate_counter</c>/<c>rpg_gate_counter_seed</c>) that no aptitude-share computation ever
/// touches.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Stamped, once, per owner, auditably.</b> <c>rpg_gate_counter_seed</c> is checked and written
/// inside the SAME transaction as the seeded <c>rpg_gate_counter</c> rows, so a crash between the two
/// cannot leave a stamp with no counters or counters with no stamp. A second call for an
/// already-stamped owner is a pure no-op — it does not even re-read the allocation. The stamp also
/// records the exact <c>commander_points_at_seed</c> the proxy was computed from, so a later audit can
/// answer "what was this player's save seeded from" without re-deriving it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Never clobbers real play.</b> A subject that already has a gate-counter row (organic credit
/// arrived before the seed pass ran, or a prior partial seed) is left untouched — a seed is a STARTING
/// value, never an addition on top of real progress and never a reduction of it. §4.1's sparsity rule
/// applies here too: a subject whose seeded count comes out to zero gets no row at all, so a fresh
/// account (commander total 0) is left with the exact zero-row state it would have had if this pass
/// never ran — "never runs for a new player" made structural rather than a branch to remember.</para>
