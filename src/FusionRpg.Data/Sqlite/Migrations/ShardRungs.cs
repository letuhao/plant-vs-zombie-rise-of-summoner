/// seed-to-concrete T4.1 (spec-rarity-migration.md §4, §7 step 6): the ten-rung rarity ladder renamed
/// four shard materials — <c>shard.common</c> → <c>shard.chaff</c>, <c>shard.rare</c> →
/// <c>shard.cultivated</c>, <c>shard.epic</c> → <c>shard.heirloom</c>, <c>shard.legendary</c> →
/// <c>shard.sunwoven</c> (the band's lowest rung, per <c>ssot-rarity.md</c> §4.3's own map — no player
/// gains value from the rename). Those ids are stored in <c>rpg_demon_materials</c> rows, so a rename
/// without a data step orphans every owned stack. This migration rewrites them, merging into the live
/// id when a player already holds both — <b>no player ends the migration with fewer materials than
/// they started with.</b>
///
/// One-shot and idempotent by construction: after running once, no <c>rpg_demon_materials</c> row uses
/// a legacy id, so a second run's <c>SELECT</c> finds nothing and touches zero rows. Runs inside
/// <see cref="RpgStore.Init"/>, immediately after <c>rpg_demon_materials</c>'s own
/// <c>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS</c>, so it applies to every store on every boot rather than needing a
/// separate opt-in step.
///
/// The four legacy ids stay <b>resolvable but unissuable</b> for one release
/// (<see cref="DemonMaterialCatalog.LegacyIds"/>) — this migration only rewrites what a player already
/// owns; it does not need to reject the old ids, that is the catalog's job.
