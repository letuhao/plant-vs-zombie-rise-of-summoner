# Spec: Game / web overlay

Status: **wave 1 built**, pending live verification. **Wave 2 built** (injector-hosted view behind `overlayHost=injector`, default off) — its z-order, focus and crash-teardown behaviour are **unproven**; the spike could not answer them off the lawn. This document is the contract for the feature — update it before changing behavior.

## Objective

Players flip between PVZ Fusion and the RPG web UI instantly, without alt-tabbing or a second monitor. A hotkey **or an on-screen button inside the game** shows the web control room exactly covering the game window; the same hotkey, the same button, or Esc returns to the game with focus restored — a Steam-overlay-style experience.

User story: *while defending the lawn I click the RPG button in the corner (or press F10), equip a specimen on `#/roster`, press F10, and I'm back in the game — the SPA never reloaded and the game never lost my match.*

### Where the view lives — two waves

| Wave | View host | Reachable when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | `FusionRpg.Launcher` WebView2 window | Game was started through the Launcher | Host built; button + transport designed |
| **2** | Injector-owned borderless window in the game process | Any way the game was started | Built, opt-in via `overlayHost=injector`; live-unverified |

Why the Launcher first: the game is Unity 2022.3 IL2CPP with no web view; the Launcher is already WPF, already supervises the game + server processes, and already knows the server URL. Wave 2 removes the "must launch through the Launcher" constraint but adds a browser runtime to the game process, so it earns its own gate rather than riding along with the button work.

**What stays rejected** (2026-08-20 investigation): rendering the web UI *inside Unity* as a texture (UnityWebBrowser and friends) — it needs the game's own Unity project plus a ~150 MB Chromium payload and carries high crash risk. Wave 2 is a **separate top-level Win32 window owned by the game process**, which is a different thing; it does not reverse that rejection.

## Tech stack

- `FusionRpg.Launcher` — net8.0-windows WPF (WPF-UI 3.0.5)
- `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` 1.0.2903.40 (Evergreen Runtime on the player machine; never bundled)
- Win32 via P/Invoke (`user32`): `RegisterHotKey`, `GetWindowRect`, `SetWindowPos`, `SetForegroundWindow`, `ShowWindow`, `IsIconic`
- `System.IO.Pipes` named pipe for the in-game button signal (both sides; no new NuGet package)
- Injector IMGUI for the button itself — the existing host `OnGUI` chain, no new draw surface

## Code style

Match the existing Launcher services: sealed/static service classes, `Try*` methods returning bool, swallow-and-log around process/window races, XML doc-comments only where the code can't say it. P/Invoke signatures stay private inside `GameWindowInterop`; the rest of the launcher never sees a raw HWND except via that class.

On the injector side, match the VFX overlay code: static class, cached `GUIStyle`, no per-frame allocation, no throw escapes into `OnGUI`.

## Behavior contract

1. **Toggle** — hotkey (default `F10`, `MOD_NOREPEAT`, registered on the main window), the **Overlay** button in the launcher, or the **in-game button** (§In-game switch button):
   - Overlay hidden → position over the game window rect (`GetWindowRect` → `SetWindowPos`, topmost), show, activate, focus WebView2. No game window found → maximized fallback.
   - Overlay visible → hide + `SetForegroundWindow(game)`.

   All three entry points converge on **one** toggle method. No entry point gets its own behavior.
2. **Session preservation** — toggling *hides*, never destroys, the WebView2 window: the SPA keeps its SignalR connection and page state. Alt+F4 on the overlay also hides. Real destruction only on launcher shutdown (`ForceClose`).
3. **URL** — active server URL from the play session; falls back to `LastPort` from settings; no URL → log "press Play first", no window.
4. **Hotkey config** — `overlayHotKey` in `%AppData%\FusionRpg\launcher.json` (any WPF `Key` name; unknown/modifier-only names fall back to F10). Registration failure (key owned by another app) logs and leaves the button as the path.
5. **WebView2 Runtime missing** — overlay shows install instructions (developer.microsoft.com link) instead of a blank window; "Open RPG UI" in a normal browser remains the fallback. User data dir: `%LocalAppData%\FusionRpg\webview2` (never next to the exe).
6. **Esc** and the in-overlay "Back to game" button behave exactly like the hotkey's hide path.
7. **Exclusive fullscreen fallback** — if the game is the foreground window in exclusive-fullscreen D3D mode (`SHQueryUserNotificationState` = `QUNS_RUNNING_D3D_FULL_SCREEN`), topmost windows can't cover it: the launcher minimizes the game and the overlay opens maximized as a normal window switch. Toggling back restores + refocuses the game (minimized-window rects are ignored by the positioner). Logged with a hint that borderless mode gives the seamless toggle.

## In-game switch button

The hotkey is invisible; players who never read the launcher won't find it. The button makes the feature discoverable from inside the match.

- **Draw surface** — the existing host `OnGUI` chain, drawn after `VfxDirector.Draw()` and `OverlaySettingsGui.Draw()`. **No new draw surface, no new host hook** — the two hosts (`RpgLoop.OnGUI` in the BepInEx plugin, `OnGUI` in the Melon mod) each gain exactly one call line, keeping the single-IMGUI-entry rule both hosts already document.
- **IMGUI event passes** — the Repaint-only gate in vfx-ssot §8.3 covers **non-interactive** draws. An interactive control cannot be Repaint-gated: IMGUI needs it drawn on the Layout and mouse passes too, or it never receives input and the Layout/Repaint control counts stop matching. `OverlaySettingsGui` already solves this by admitting exactly `Repaint`, `Layout`, `MouseDown`, `MouseUp` and dropping every other event type — the button uses the same filter. It pays for the extra passes by being one `GUI.Button` with a cached `GUIStyle` and a cached `Rect`: no allocation, no scan, no `FindObjectsOfType`.
- **Placement** — small corner button, screen-space, bottom-right: outside the card tray and the shovel slot so it never eats a gameplay click. Geometry lives in Core (`OverlaySwitchLayout`) and **scales with display height** (1× at 1080p, capped at 3×, never below 1×) — IMGUI works in device pixels, so a fixed-pixel button is half the physical size on a 4K screen.
- **Visibility** — needs all three of: a **live board**, a reachable host, and the player's preference. The preference toggle lives in `OverlaySettings` alongside the existing F7/F9 ones, default on. No reachable host means no dead button in a game started outside the Launcher; **no live board means no button over menus** — the corner was chosen against the in-match HUD, not against menu screens, and the global hotkey still works everywhere, so gating costs nothing.
- **Not a cheats surface.** The button carries one action: show/hide the web UI. Any gameplay control belongs in the web document, per the cheats SSOT row in [decisions.md](../architecture/decisions.md). Adding a second action to this button is ask-first.
- **Hotkey unchanged.** F10 stays a launcher-registered global hotkey and keeps working while the game has focus, with or without the button.

## Transport — named pipe

The Launcher is not a hub client, and the button must not depend on the server being healthy. The injector signals the Launcher directly.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Pipe | `\\.\pipe\FusionRpg.Overlay`, local machine only (`NamedPipeClientStream(".", …)`) |
| Direction | One-way, injector → launcher |
| Server | Launcher: async accept loop, one message per connection |
| Protocol | One ASCII line: `toggle` or `ping`. Unknown line → log + ignore, never throw. Only what the injector actually sends — unreachable verbs are untested surface, so wave 2 adds its own when something calls them |
| ACL | Windows default for named pipes: full control to the creator, LocalSystem and administrators; **read** to Everyone. The pipe is `PipeDirection.In`, so read access alone cannot send a command — only a same-user process can write. No remote clients (`NamedPipeClientStream(".", ...)`), no impersonation |

Rules:

- **Never on the Unity main thread.** A click sets an intent flag; a background worker connects (250 ms timeout), writes one line, disposes. A pipe connect that blocks a frame is exactly the class of main-thread stall the perf work removed — do not reintroduce it. Note this is the **first background work in the injector** (no `Task.Run` / `Thread` existed there before), so the worker must swallow every exception and must never touch a Unity API.
- **Debounce 300 ms.** A held or double click sends one message. The **in-flight gate comes first**: a connect can take 250 ms, so a send may outlive the window, and a click landing during one is refused *without* being recorded as a send — otherwise a click that never reached the pipe would silently push the window forward and lock the player out for another 300 ms.
- **Availability probe** — `ping` on match start and every 30 s, off-thread. The cached result drives button visibility. Never probe per frame.
- **Log on transition only** — one line when the host becomes reachable or unreachable, never per attempt.
- **One code path on the launcher side** — the pipe handler marshals to the UI thread and calls the same toggle method as `WM_HOTKEY`. The pipe must not grow its own show/hide logic.
- **Client timeout.** A connected client gets 2 s to send its line. With a single server instance, a client that connects and never writes would otherwise park the listener for the rest of the session and silently kill the button.
- **One owner per machine.** The pipe allows a single server instance, so a second launcher cannot claim it. Claiming the name and serving a connection therefore fail for different reasons and are handled differently: a launcher that cannot claim it says so **once** and re-checks every 5 s quietly, then logs again only when it takes over. Treating that as an ordinary connection error logs twice a second for as long as both launchers run.

Rejected transports:

| Rejected | Why |
|---|---|
| Server relay (`POST /api/overlay/toggle` → launcher subscribes) | Makes the Launcher a hub/poll client for one boolean; adds RTT and a failure mode where the server is down but game and launcher are fine |
| Synthetic keystroke (`keybd_event` F10) | Injects global input, breaks when the hotkey is rebound or its registration failed, and fires into whatever app is focused |
| `PostMessage` to a launcher window found by title | Fragile title/class matching, no delivery confirmation, no room for a protocol |

## Wave 2 — injector-hosted view (gated)

Wave 2 moves the view into the game process so the overlay exists however the game was started.

- Selected by `overlayHost` = `launcher` or `injector` (host config + `FUSIONRPG_OVERLAY_HOST` env override, env wins — matches the `FUSIONRPG_SERVER_URL` convention). An unusable value falls through rather than overriding, so an env typo cannot discard a deliberate config choice; the final fallback is `launcher`. **Default stays `launcher`** — guard-pinned, and flipping it is ask-first.
- **Threading (locked by the spike).** `OverlayViewHost` owns one STA thread and pumps it; the WebView2 environment, controller and CoreWebView2 are created *and* only ever touched there. Never the Unity thread, never the pool — crossing apartments fails every call with a `NotImplementedException` that misleadingly blames version skew. The Unity thread only enqueues commands.
- **Window.** Borderless `WS_POPUP` + `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` (kept out of alt-tab), positioned over the largest visible top-level window this process owns, topmost. No game window found → primary display rect rather than a 0×0 window. All P/Invoke stays in `Hud/Win32.cs`, mirroring the Launcher’s `GameWindowInterop` rule.
- **Native loading.** The SDK imports `WebView2Loader.dll` by bare name and the process search path is rooted at the game exe, not our plugin folder, so the host pre-loads it by absolute path first; the later bare-name import then binds to the already-loaded module.
- **Payload.** Only `Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.dll` + the x64 loader reach the player (~752 KB). The package’s WPF/WinForms wrappers, XML docs and arm64/x86 natives are trimmed by MSBuild targets and guard-pinned — everything referenced lands in the player’s game folder.
- **Teardown.** Both hosts call `OverlaySwitch.Shutdown()` from `OnApplicationQuit`. An orphaned `msedgewebview2.exe` is the spike’s stated no-go — check it by command line (`*FusionRpg*`), never by process name: a normal desktop runs a dozen unrelated WebView2 processes from Edge.
- **Degradation.** No Evergreen runtime, no loader, or any init failure → logged once, `Available` stays false, the button hides. Never a crash, never a hang.
- With `injector`, the button calls the local host directly and the pipe client is bypassed. Behavior contract rules 1–7 are unchanged from the player's side.
- **Spike must answer, before any build:** does the WebView2 loader initialize in an IL2CPP process; can a borderless window owned by the game HWND stay correctly z-ordered and focused; does input routing survive alt-tab; does teardown run cleanly when the game exits or crashes; what happens with no Evergreen runtime.
- **Spike status (2026-08-22)** — [../research/2026-08-22-overlay-injector-host.md](../research/2026-08-22-overlay-injector-host.md). Loader init and the missing-runtime path are answered; z-order, focus-across-alt-tab and the crash teardown still need the game. Nothing found blocks wave 2, but it is **not** a go yet.
- **If wave 2 proceeds:** the WebView2 objects are apartment-bound — environment, controller and CoreWebView2 must be created *and* consumed on one thread the injector owns and pumps (a second pump beside Unity's), never the Unity thread and never the pool. Standing the view up costs ~270–315 ms, so it is created once in the background and thereafter only shown/hidden. What ships is `Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.dll` + native `WebView2Loader.dll` (~166 KB) — **not** Chromium, so the no-embedded-browser boundary holds; the NuGet dependency in the game process is still ask-first.
- If the spike fails on any of those, wave 1 stands and this section records why.

## Testing strategy

- **Unit (CI):** hotkey-name parsing (`GameWindowInteropTests`, table-driven), pipe command parsing (`OverlayPipeServerTests`, table-driven), and the injector switch state machine (`OverlaySwitchStateTests`: debounce window, probe cache expiry, visibility gate, transition-only logging). Real pipe I/O **is** covered (`OverlayPipeServerRoundTripTests`: a client's line reaches the handler, junk does not dispatch, `Dispose` stops the listener) — each test takes a unique pipe name so it never collides with a launcher running on the same machine. Win32, WebView2, and IMGUI stay untested (no game window / runtime in CI).
- **Contract guard:** the pipe name and verbs are duplicated as literals on both sides (the launcher and injector share no assembly), so nothing at compile time links them. `OverlayPipeContractGuardTests` reads both source files and the spec and fails if the names diverge or the injector sends a verb `ParseCommand` does not map — the failure mode otherwise is a button that silently hides itself.
- **Guards:** `guard-secondary-no-unity` does **not** cover this code — it scans `Core/Effects/Plugins` and `IEffectGrantPlugin` implementers only. What keeps the state machine honest is its home: `FusionRpg.Core` has no UnityEngine reference (the same guard asserts that on the csproj), so `OverlaySwitchState` cannot drift into Unity. Inside the injector only `OverlaySwitchGui` touches Unity; `OverlaySwitch` touches only the pipe.
- **Live checklist (dev machine, once per release):**
  1. `deploy-play.ps1` → Play → in-game press F10 → overlay covers the game window exactly; UI is the lawn control room.
  2. F10 / Esc → back in game, game has focus and input.
  3. Toggle twice more → SPA did not reload (Log page ring buffer keeps its entries).
  4. Close overlay with Alt+F4 → hides, game focused; F10 brings it back instantly.
  5. Stop all in launcher → no orphaned overlay window, hotkey unregistered (F10 does nothing).
  6. Negative: rename the WebView2 runtime check (or test on a machine without it) → instruction text shows, no crash.
  7. In-game button visible during a match → click shows the overlay; click "Back to game" → button still there, match intact.
  7b. Leave the match → button is gone from the menus; start another → it is back.
  7c. Button is legible and hittable at the display's real resolution (check on 4K if available).
  8. Start the game **without** the launcher → button is absent (probe found no host), no log spam, no frame cost.
  9. Kill the launcher mid-match → button disappears within one probe interval; a click during the gap logs once and does nothing.
  10. Hold / double-click the button → exactly one toggle (debounce).
  11. Frame time with the button drawn is indistinguishable from the button hidden (perf probe, scenario of choice).

  **Wave 2 only** (`FUSIONRPG_OVERLAY_HOST=injector`, launcher not needed):

  12. The in-game view opens on the button and **covers the game window** — if the game paints over it, z-order lost and wave 2 is dead as designed.
  13. Click into the view, type, alt-tab away and back: input still lands in the view, the game is not receiving it underneath, and the view stays on the right monitor.
  14. Quit the game normally, **then** repeat and kill it from Task Manager. After each, check for a leak with:

      ```powershell
      Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='msedgewebview2.exe'" |
        Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like "*FusionRpg*" }
      ```

      Filter by **our user-data folder, never by process name** — a normal desktop runs a dozen unrelated `msedgewebview2.exe` from Edge, so a bare name check reports a leak every time. Expect no rows. A real leak reverts wave 2.
  15. With no Evergreen runtime (or rename the loader), the game still starts, the button stays hidden, and the log says why once.

## Boundaries

- **Always:** run launcher unit tests before handing back; keep all Win32 inside `GameWindowInterop`; keep the overlay hide-not-destroy invariant; keep every toggle entry point on one code path; keep pipe I/O off the Unity main thread; log every failure path (no silent no-ops).
- **Ask first:** changing the default hotkey; adding a settings UI; bundling/auto-installing the WebView2 Runtime; making the overlay pause or send input to the game; adding any second action to the in-game button; flipping `overlayHost` to `injector` by default; new NuGet dependencies.
- **Never:** touch the game process/window beyond focus + rect reads; route gameplay input or gameplay state through the overlay pipe; make the in-game button a second cheats surface; render the web UI inside Unity as a texture; ship an embedded browser inside the game folder in wave 1; auto-close the game.

## Resolved decisions

**2026-08-20**

1. **Exclusive fullscreen** → fallback to window switch (behavior rule 7), not just a documented limitation.
2. **Default hotkey** → stays `F10` (JSON-configurable; F8 reserved by injector cheat conventions).
3. **WebView2 Runtime missing** → install link + instructions only; a one-click bootstrapper waits for a real player report.

**2026-08-22**

4. **View host** → launcher now, injector later behind `overlayHost`; in-Unity texture embedding stays rejected.
5. **Switch surface** → on-screen button **and** hotkey, button visibility toggleable in `OverlaySettings`.
6. **Transport** → local named pipe, injector → launcher; server relay and synthetic keystrokes rejected.
7. **Button is in-match chrome** → hidden outside a live board. Its corner was picked against the seed bank and shovel, not menu screens, and the global hotkey covers the menus.
8. **Button scales with display height** → 1× at 1080p, capped 3×, never below 1×. Geometry is pure and lives in Core.
9. **Wire protocol is `toggle` + `ping` only** → `show` / `hide` dropped; nothing sent them, and wave 2 adds what it calls.

## Open questions

- **Pause on show?** The injector already owns `MatchHost.NotifyPaused`, so pausing the match while the overlay is up is now cheap. The boundary above says ask first — unanswered.
- **Remember last overlay page** across toggles — still out of scope, but the button makes short visits common enough that it may be worth revisiting.

## Out of scope v1

Hotkey settings UI, overlay opacity/click-through mode, remembering last overlay page, per-monitor DPI edge cases beyond `SetWindowPos` device pixels, any button action beyond show/hide.
