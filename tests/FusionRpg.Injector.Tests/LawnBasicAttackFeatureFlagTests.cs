/// <para><b>The actual defect was architectural, not a bug to patch in <c>CheatState</c>'s rehydrate
/// path.</b> <c>CheatState</c>'s own class doc names its real scope: "Session cheat registry keyed by
/// coverage ids from cheat-menu-coverage.md" — an ephemeral debug/QA toggle store. It never promised a
/// durable, always-correct default for a real production gameplay switch, so borrowing
/// <c>CheatSchema.EffectiveToggle</c>'s fallback as this flag's ONLY source of "on by default" (T10's
/// original shape, mirroring the pre-existing <c>OVERLAY-COMBAT</c> pattern) was itself the defect —
/// a SOLID-boundary violation (this repo's CLAUDE.md: depend on the system that owns a concern, never
/// borrow one whose contract doesn't promise what you need), not a broken rehydrate. The fix gives
/// <see cref="LawnBasicAttackFeature"/> its own independent <c>DefaultOn</c> const and treats
/// <c>CheatState</c> as an optional, EXPLICIT debug/QA override layered on top — never the source of
/// the default itself. These tests prove exactly that shape. <c>OVERLAY-COMBAT</c> has the identical
/// pre-existing shape and is a same-class finding for a separate task — not touched here.</para>
