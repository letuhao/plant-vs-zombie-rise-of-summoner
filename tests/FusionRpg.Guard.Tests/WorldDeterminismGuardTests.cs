/// <para><b>base-defense Gate 0 part 2 (2026-09-05):</b> widened the clock/RNG scan from
/// <c>Core/World</c> to <c>Core/World + Core/Battle + Core/Effects</c> — a siege resolves inside
/// <c>Core/Battle</c> and reads <c>Core/Effects</c>, so a wall clock or an unowned RNG in either tree
/// is exactly as replay-breaking as one in <c>World</c>. Widening surfaced three real defects in the
/// guard itself, fixed alongside the scope change rather than worked around:</para>
///
/// <para><b>1. The scan stopped at the first match per (file, symbol).</b> <c>text.IndexOf</c> found
/// only the first occurrence, so a comment mentioning a banned symbol before a real usage would have
/// masked the real one entirely. Now scans every occurrence.</para>
///
/// <para><b>2. The scan was comment-blind.</b> A doc comment that explains the rule — "never
/// System.Random", "Owned-PRNG adapter... never System.Random" — contains the banned substring and
/// tripped the ban meant to enforce the rule it was documenting. `Core/World` never had this problem
/// because nothing in it happened to explain the rule in prose; `Core/Battle`/`Core/Effects` are full
/// of exactly that prose (four hits on first widening, all comments, zero real violations). Comment
/// text is now stripped before matching, the same discipline <see cref="ReadsTheWorldItself"/>
/// already applies one line at a time.</para>
///
/// <para><b>3. The float-purity check does NOT widen with the clock/RNG check.</b> `Core/Battle`'s
/// derived-stat/aura recompose system (aura-skill T4: <c>ActorDerivedSnapshot</c>,
/// <c>BattleDerivedModifierLedger</c>, <c>combat.*</c> channel values) is `double`-typed by a prior,
/// reviewed, already-shipped program — not something Gate 0 for base-defense has license to relitigate
/// into a fixed-point refactor. Every `double` found on first widening is either that subsystem
/// (recompute-each-battle intermediate math, never itself hashed — only the resolved `long` outcome
/// is) or presentation (`DamageFx`, `UiPresentSink` — VFX/UI, not simulation). Rule 8 in
/// base-defense-ideal.md §2 says "integer/fixed-point only in <b>game-affecting branches</b>", not
/// "everywhere `Core/Battle` touches" — so this check stays scoped to `Core/World`'s own stored,
