/// in this project runs in-process inside the test host, which already has every tuning hub
/// configured globally (`ContractTuningTestBootstrap`'s `[ModuleInitializer]`), so none of them could
/// ever catch a missing `Configure(...)` call the standalone binary itself needs. Found for real
/// 2026-08-30 running an actual deploy: `RpgStore`'s static ctor (T2's `ComposeKindRegistry`) needs
/// `DerivedStatPolicy.Tuning`, and this tool never configured it — the in-process test suite was
/// 21/21 green the whole time this was broken.</summary>
///
/// <para><b>Why the apphost and not `dotnet run` (2026-09-12):</b> `dotnet run` performs an implicit
/// MSBuild build, which races every concurrent `dotnet build`/`dotnet test` touching the same
/// `FusionRpg.Core.dll`/`FusionRpg.Data.dll` outputs — a transient MSB3026/MSB3027 file lock, not a
/// defect in this tool or this test. The old code papered over that with a 3-attempt retry (375s
/// worst case) and still left the test depending on a build it never arranged. This project already
/// has a `ProjectReference` to AtomImporter, so the test host's own build produces the tool's apphost
/// beside the test dll; the test now launches that directly. It is still a separate process with its
/// own statics and composition root — the cold-process property this test exists for is unchanged —
/// but there is no build, no lock race, and so no retry is needed.</para>
