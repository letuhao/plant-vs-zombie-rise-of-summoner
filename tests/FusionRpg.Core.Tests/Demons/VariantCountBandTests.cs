/// so a bad classification anywhere else in the corpus was invisible — and two were live at once:

/// with <b>7</b>, in a corpus where every other almanac row has exactly 4.</para>
///
/// <para>⭐ <b>The law was always in the data; nothing enforced it.</b> Across 841 rows the variant
/// count tracks the rarity rung tightly and monotonically — which is exactly what makes an outlier
/// meaningful rather than merely unusual. Stating it here means a future classification pass cannot
/// quietly break it, the same "make the implicit rule explicit" move the power ladder and the atom
/// vocabulary already use elsewhere in this repo.</para>
