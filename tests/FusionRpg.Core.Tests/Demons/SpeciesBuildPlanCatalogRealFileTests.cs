/// bug ship. Every existing caller of <see cref="SpeciesBuildPlanCatalog"/> (e.g.
/// <c>FusionRpg.Server.Tests.SpeciesBuildEndpointsTests</c>) configures it with a hand-built fixture
/// dictionary that is ALREADY keyed with the correct lowercase runtime id, so none of them could
/// ever notice that the real committed file used a completely different key space (seedsmith-anchor
/// PascalCase, e.g. <c>"FumeShroom"</c>, vs. <see cref="DemonSpeciesCatalog"/>'s lowercase runtime id,
/// e.g. <c>"fumeshroom"</c> — zero exact-string overlap between the two). This file loads the REAL
/// committed <c>data/generated/demons/_species-build-plan.json</c> through the real
/// <see cref="SpeciesBuildPlanReader"/> — no hand-built fixture anywhere in it.
///
/// <para><b>⛔ Real bug fixed 2026-09-07 (owner caught it: "why did we still stuck at 84 demon"):</b>
/// this file used to check the plan against <see cref="DemonSpeciesCatalog.ConfigureFromCompiledDefault"/>
/// — the compiled, 84-species snapshot from BEFORE `catalog-runtime`'s real flip (2026-09-05). That
/// flip already moved the real, live game (<c>Server/Program.cs:350</c>,
/// <c>Injector/Host/RpgHost.cs</c>) onto the full store-backed roster (904 species today); this test
/// file alone never followed, so it was silently validating the plan against a roster the real game
/// no longer uses. `tools/DemonBuildPlanGen` itself had the exact same bug (fixed the same day,
/// same root cause) — together they explain why the committed plan was stuck at 84 species long
/// after the corpus grew to 904. Fixed by scoping every test here to
/// <see cref="RealCorpusFixture.Snapshot"/> — the SAME real, store-backed 904-species roster
/// <c>FusionRecipeReconcileTests</c> already uses, re-derived from the real anchor corpus through the
/// real pipeline, never the stale compiled default.</para>
