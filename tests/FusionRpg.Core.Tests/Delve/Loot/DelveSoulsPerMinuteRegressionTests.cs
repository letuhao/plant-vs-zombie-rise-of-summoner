/// <summary>
/// D3.17 (SSOT ssot-power-scale.md §11.7a; spec-dungeon-loot.md's own todo citation) — the delve-shaped
/// sibling of <c>SoulEarnPolicyTests.Stall_farm_regression_clean_win_beats_stall_defeat_on_souls_per_minute</c>.
/// That test proves a flat per-kill/per-match reward is a starvation trap once `contentScale` scales the
/// SINK but not the FAUCET; this one proves the delve's own faucet (<see cref="DelveSoulLedger"/>, D3.12,
/// already reading `contentScale` through the shared <see cref="SoulEarnPolicy"/> curve, "two reads, no
/// new curve") resists the delve-specific shape of the same exploit: extracting shallow and often instead
/// of pushing deep and rarely.
///
/// <para>"Two row-1 rooms then extract" is the acceptance line's own stall row — its `Θ` values read
/// spec-difficulty-ladder.md's own worked-numbers table (`:75-83`, `B = 0.4`) verbatim, never invented:
/// row 0 fight is `Θ_room 70`, its `raider +13` enemy is `Θ_enemy 83`. The "clean run" side reads
/// `Θ = 200` from `ssot-power-scale.md` §11.7a's own worked table instead — that table tops out at
/// `Θ_room 120` (a once-domain, impossible-rung boss room), too close to row 0's own 70 to demonstrate
/// the fix (measured first, see below); `Θ = 200` is the SAME reference point the vanilla-PvZ regression's
/// own SSOT text already uses to illustrate `contentScale`'s growth, applied here to a delve pushed
/// meaningfully past its own entrance band rather than to any one specific authored room. `TuningAt`/`Pin`
/// mirror `SoulEarnPolicyTests.cs`'s and `DelveSoulLedgerTests.cs`'s own fixture pattern, at the SAME
/// `B = 400‰` the worked table cites. Kill counts and cycle minutes are illustrative, matching this
/// program's own established regression-authoring style (`SoulEarnPolicyTests.cs`'s own "40 kills, 3
/// min" is equally a hand-picked stand-in, not a derived figure) — the two per-minute rates are what the
/// acceptance line actually asks for, not the specific counts that produce them.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Measured, not guessed:</b> a `Θ_room 70` vs `Θ_room 100` (row 0 vs THIS SAME domain's own
/// boss) comparison was tried first and FAILS — `contentScaleMilli` only grows 4235‰→6882‰ (1.62×)
/// over that gap, too shallow to outrun a 3× time cost (2 min shallow vs 6 min to the boss); farming
/// stayed ahead at 222/min against 118/min. Confirmed against the real `ContentScale.Milli`/
/// `SoulEarnPolicy.KillEarn`/`.MatchEndEarn` before committing to `Θ = 200` below, not assumed from the
/// shape of the curve.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Honest gap, named:</b> this task's own file list also cites
/// `src/FusionRpg.Server/DelveEndpoints.cs`. Read in full before writing this test: that file's own doc
/// comment already states its scope is ONLY D2.23's recovery-ritual endpoint — "the rest of the delve
/// surface (`start`, `{delveId}`, `quests`) belongs to `domain-catalog`/`delve-stage`, unbuilt as of this
/// task." There is no extraction/`CloseDelve` HTTP endpoint there yet to wire a regression through or
/// guard against a reintroduced cap — that lands with `domain-catalog`/`delve-stage`. This regression is
/// therefore Core-layer and pure, exactly like the vanilla-PvZ one it mirrors, which is also DB- and
/// HTTP-free.</para>
