/// E28 test 12 (spec-param-parity.md §5, acceptance criterion 8): <i>"a declared param that reaches no

/// fix) closed one instance of the exact same defect shape: a param declared on a kind's
/// <see cref="ParamSchema"/> — so it validates, so an author can write it — that no executor ever read.
/// Tests 1-11 (see <c>ParamSchemaVsExecutorTests.cs</c>, a pre-E28/D7 file that proves specific
/// name/type mismatches, and the per-fix tests the module's own todo entry names) each prove ONE
/// instance now works. <b>This file is the generic form</b>: it walks every kind
/// <see cref="AtomKindRegistry"/> actually ships, every param each one actually declares, and asserts
/// the param's name literally appears in the real source of whichever file(s) consume that kind — read
/// as plain TEXT, the same "does the source actually reference X" technique
/// <c>tests/FusionRpg.Guard.Tests/PlantSideStatusGuardTests.cs</c> and
/// <c>SpawnNonGridExecutorGuardTests.cs</c> use for the Injector's own Unity-hosted half. A future
/// thirteenth kind, or a new param on an existing one, needs no new test written — it is caught by
/// walking the registry, not by a hand-added case.
///
/// <para><b>Why this lives in Core.Tests, not Guard.Tests, despite reusing Guard.Tests' own
/// text-scanning technique.</b> <c>tests/FusionRpg.Guard.Tests/*.csproj</c> carries ZERO
/// <c>ProjectReference</c> to <c>FusionRpg.Core</c> — verified by reading every one of its (then) 32
/// existing test files: not one has a <c>using FusionRpg.*</c> line, and the csproj itself lists only
/// the xunit/Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk packages. That is a deliberate, consistent project boundary
/// (dependency-free, text/process-scanning only), not an oversight, and adding a
/// <c>ProjectReference</c> there to make <see cref="AtomKindRegistry"/> reachable would itself be an
/// undiscussed structural change to that boundary — exactly the kind of thing to flag rather than do
/// silently. This module's own "generic, not a dozen hand-copied per-kind cases" requirement means the
/// walk must read the REAL <see cref="AtomKindRegistry.All"/> and each kind's REAL
/// <see cref="ParamSchema.Defs"/>, never a hand-maintained mirror of them — that is only reachable from
/// a project that already references Core. Reading an Injector <c>.cs</c> file as plain TEXT (the
/// actual "does the executor read this" proof) needs no compilation of the Injector project at all, so
/// that half costs nothing extra to do from here too — Core.Tests already carries the same idea one
/// step further, `&lt;Compile Include&gt;`-ing a handful of individually Unity-free Injector files
/// directly (see this project's own .csproj, `PatronAuraOverlay.cs` etc.). Core.Tests already builds
/// and runs under CI with no <c>$env:FUSIONRPG_GAME_DIR</c> requirement, so this test runs on every

    // ---- the map: kindId -> the real file(s) that consume its declared params ---------------------
    //
    // This is the "which file(s)/method(s) is this kind's real consumer" input the spec's own
    // instructions call out as fine and expected to hand-write — it names WHERE to look, not WHETHER a
    // param passes. Several kinds share a consumer file (all board-attach kinds plus stat.modify's
    // `channel`, status.apply/clear, spawn.entity, wave.control, match.modify, resource.economy's
    // `currency`/`op`/`amount` all execute through `InjectorEffectActionSink.cs`'s own opcode
    // switch — FA1/FA9/FA2/FA3/FA4/FA5/FA6/FA7/FA8, one file, many opcodes). Four kinds are genuinely
    // different consumer shapes, each verified by reading the real method before it went in this map:
    //
    //  - `stat.modify`/`stat.derived`'s `op`/`amount` are NOT read by name anywhere in the sink at
    //    all — `AtomCompiler.ToOpcodeShape` rewrites `{op:"flat", amount:150}` into `{flat:150}`
    //    *before* the row ever reaches an executor (FA1 "reads flat/increased/more... and knows
    //    nothing about op or amount", the compiler's own doc comment). Their real consumer for those
    //    two params is the compiler, not the sink.
    //  - `resource.delta`'s DoT/contagion payload (`statusId`/`periodMs`/`durationMs`/`tickBudget`/
    //    `spread`) is bag-side: `EffectBag`'s own `ApplyResourceDelta` branch calls
    //    `StatusEffectBridge.TryApplyFromGrant` directly and never builds a plan item for those keys at
    //    all (D7's own note on the kind: "the DoT and contagion payload lives HERE... EffectBag calls
    //    StatusEffectBridge.TryApplyFromGrant only inside the ApplyResourceDelta branch"). `amount`/
    //    `element`/`target` on the same kind resolve through `DamagePacketBuilder.FromOverlay`,
    //    likewise bag-side, before any FA10 plan item exists — `channel`/`amount` are also read a
    //    second time in the sink's own `ExecApplyResourceDelta` (the multi-target spread sub-plan).
    //  - `shield.grant` and `ui.present` are both bag-side executors living directly in
    //    `EffectBag.cs` (`ExecGrantShield`/`ExecPresentUi`) — FA11-equivalent and Ui-attached kinds
    //    never become an `EffectActionPlanItem` and never reach the sink at all (E41's own "the
    //    module's central read-only invariant").
    //  - `stat.derived`'s `channel` and `bullet.modify`'s four params are resolved-read, permanent-
    //    modifier shapes: no sink opcode exists for either, so a live grant's own compiled action row
    //    is read directly by `GrantedDerivedAtomReader`/`GrantedBulletModifyAtomReader` at resolve
    //    time (the "grant's presence is the effect" shape both kinds' own doc comments describe).
