/// public surface or the <see cref="BattleEngine.HeldActionIdsForTest"/> seam added alongside it —
/// <c>BattleRunState</c> itself stays private/nested per B13's own deviation note, and nothing in the
/// round loop reads <c>HeldActionsOf</c> for real behavior yet (same gap
/// <c>EquippedActionIdsReportingTests</c> already documents for the pre-existing loadout mechanism),
