/// Task C3 — "Catalog record hardening: the axis, the enums, the reflection sweep"
/// (spec-tree-catalog.md §2.1 R7, §2.2 D40, §2.3, §2.4, §3, §Success criteria).
///
/// Read against B2's shipped loader/records before writing anything here (`PassiveTreeCatalogLoader
/// .cs`, `NodeAtom.cs`, `NodeRecord.cs`, `TreeRecord.cs`, `PassiveTreeCatalogLoaderTests.cs`): three
/// of C3's four numbered gaps are ALREADY closed by B2, verified line-by-line rather than assumed —
///
///   1. scaleAxis/UnitClass disagreement, naming both values:
///      `PassiveTreeCatalogLoader.LoadAtom`'s `expectedAxis` switch + refusal message, tested by
///      `PassiveTreeCatalogLoaderTests.A_sigmoid_channel_carrying_PTheta_is_refused_the_silent_failure_class`.
///   2. the five-value `TreeCategory` enum + the plan-token import map, refusing an unknown token by
///      name: `TreeRecord.cs`'s `TreeCategory` enum + `PassiveTreeCatalogLoader.CategoryTokenMap`,
///      tested by `PassiveTreeCatalogLoaderTests.A_category_token_outside_the_five_value_map_is_refused_naming_it`.
///      Cross-checked against `tools/seedsmith/seedsmith/adapters/trees/plan/emit.py:41,154` — the
///      plan emits the canonical five tokens directly (`"primary" | "elemental" | "status" | "family"
///      | "species"`), not the `aptitude`/`demonFamily` renames the spec's prose describes; the map
///      already carries both spellings defensively, so there is no live gap to close.
///   3a. exclusionForm/excludeProps disagreement in both directions, and IdMismatch kept as authored
///      (never rewritten): both already refuse and both already have named tests in
///      `PassiveTreeCatalogLoaderTests.cs`.
///
/// Restating any of those with a new test would not be a gap — it would be coverage duplication,
/// which C3's own instructions rule out. Two real, previously-untested gaps remained, and this file
/// closes them:
///
///   3b. `soulCurveId` had ZERO format validation before this task — any string, including a bare
///       formula/expression, loaded silently. Closed (2026-09-06) by `PassiveTreeCatalogLoader`'s new
///       `SoulCurveIdPattern` check. **Superseded 2026-09-07 (J12, D58, spec-soul-curve-resolution.md):
///       `NodeAtom.SoulCurveId` had zero consumers that ever acted on its value — retired entirely
///       rather than extended. `SoulCurveIdPattern` and all four tests this gap's own closure added are
///       removed below, not left asserting a field that no longer exists.**
///   4.  no reflection sweep existed proving every stored magnitude is `long`, nor one that would
///       fail if a `float` field were added. Closed below, with an automated falsifiability proof —
///       `The_float_or_double_sweep_actually_turns_red_on_a_planted_float_field` and
///       `The_classification_sweep_actually_turns_red_on_an_unclassified_numeric_field` run the exact
///       same helpers the production sweeps call, against decoy types built to fail them, rather than
///       asserting by code comment that a manual edit was tried and reverted.
