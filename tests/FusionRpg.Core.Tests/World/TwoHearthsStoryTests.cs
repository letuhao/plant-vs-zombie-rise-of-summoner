/// L19 acceptance (spec-loam-maps.md): the cut-off-and-lost story, played through the real engine
/// on `two-hearths` — not asserted against `LoamPhases` in isolation.
///
/// **A note on the story's shape.** The spec's phrasing is "take a rootbed sector, hold it, get cut
/// off, lose it." Played through: `hot-ground` (the map's rootbed prize) sits behind four unowned
/// corridor sectors, so claiming it never actually connects it to Dave's territory in
/// `TerritoryComponents`' sense — it becomes its own isolated component the instant it is claimed,
/// and with two rootbeds of its own it is self-sufficient (production comfortably exceeds its
/// upkeep). It cannot be "lost" to the fade by design; that is the settlement rule's *positive*
/// case, not a story to script. The story below claims ordinary ground instead — `corridor-1`, which
/// starts subsidised by Dave's capital cluster once connected, and fades once the lane that connects
/// it is severed. That is the actual anchoring lesson: a rootbed holding is safe on its own; ordinary
/// ground needs the chain home, and losing the chain is what "cut off" means.
